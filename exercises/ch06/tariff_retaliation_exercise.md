# Tabletop Exercise: Tariff Escalation and Trade War Dynamics

**Chapter:** 6 - Trade Controls and Tariffs

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Analyze escalation dynamics in trade conflicts
- Evaluate effectiveness of tariffs as coercive tools
- Understand domestic political economy of trade protection
- Assess WTO constraints and workarounds in trade disputes

## Scenario Overview

**Date: January 2028**

The United States announces sweeping new tariffs on Chinese imports under Section 301, citing unfair trade practices, forced technology transfer, and industrial subsidies. The measures include:
- 60% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and batteries
- 40% tariffs on solar panels and wind turbines
- 25% tariffs on advanced manufactured goods (semiconductors, machinery, aerospace components)

China retaliates within 48 hours with:
- 50% tariffs on U.S. agricultural products (soybeans, pork, wheat)
- 40% tariffs on U.S. aircraft (targeting Boeing)
- 30% tariffs on U.S. energy exports (LNG, crude oil)
- Initiation of anti-dumping and anti-monopoly investigations against U.S. firms

Both sides frame their actions as defensive responses to the other's unfair practices. Global markets react with volatility. U.S. allies express concern about being caught in the crossfire.

You are convened as the Trade Policy Review Group to assess the situation and develop next steps as the trade war threatens to spiral.

## Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Initial Retaliation (Minutes 0-20)

**Inject 1: Economic Impact**

Within one week:
- U.S. farmers face collapse in soybean prices ($2 billion in losses projected)
- Boeing announces potential layoffs (China cancels $20 billion in aircraft orders)
- U.S. automakers report disruption (dependent on Chinese battery components)
- Consumer prices increase for electronics, appliances, household goods
- Stock market drops 8% on recession fears

Chinese state media declares "trade war brings pain to both sides, but China can endure longer."

**Key Questions:**
1. Should the U.S. escalate with additional tariffs, hold position, or seek de-escalation?
2. How do you compensate domestic constituencies (farmers, manufacturers) hurt by retaliation?
3. What are realistic objectives: forced Chinese concessions, reduced bilateral trade dependence, or symbolic demonstration of resolve?

### Phase 2: Allied Pressure and Third-Party Effects (Minutes 20-45)

**Inject 2: Allied Concerns**

- **EU:** Complains U.S. tariffs violate WTO rules; threatens counter-tariffs if U.S. doesn't exempt European goods
- **Japan/South Korea:** Warn that their firms caught in supply chain crossfire will be disadvantaged versus Chinese competitors
- **ASEAN countries:** Fear becoming pressure points as both U.S. and China seek alternative trade routes through Southeast Asia
- **Taiwan:** Concerned that U.S.-China trade war reduces Taiwanese leverage and economic importance

**Inject 3: Chinese Economic Warfare**

Beyond tariffs, China implements:
- Informal import bans on U.S. goods (customs delays, regulatory harassment)
- Investigations and fines against U.S. companies operating in China (Apple, Tesla, Microsoft face "anti-monopoly" actions)
- "Unreliable Entity List" designating U.S. firms for restrictions
- Encouragement of consumer boycotts against U.S. brands

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you coordinate with allies to create united front versus allowing each country to cut separate deals with China?
2. Should U.S. respond to Chinese non-tariff barriers with its own informal restrictions?
3. What is the appropriate forum: bilateral negotiations, WTO dispute settlement, or plurilateral coalition?

### Phase 3: Escalation or De-escalation (Minutes 45-70)

**Inject 4: Domestic Political Pressure**

- **Farm state senators:** Demand emergency agricultural subsidies and threaten to block administration priorities
- **Manufacturing CEOs:** Split between those benefiting from protection and those hurt by supply chain disruptions
- **Consumer groups:** Protest rising prices and inflation
- **Labor unions:** Support tariffs on Chinese goods but oppose automation that tariffs might accelerate
- **Congressional leadership:** Demands trade deal before midterm elections

**Inject 5: Chinese Offer**

Through back channels, China signals willingness to negotiate if:
1. U.S. removes Section 301 tariffs
2. U.S. ends semiconductor export controls
3. U.S. stops arms sales to Taiwan

Short of these demands, China offers modest concessions:
- Increased purchases of U.S. agricultural products ($20 billion annually)
- Slight reduction in Chinese tariffs (from 50% to 30% on some goods)
- Vague commitments on intellectual property protection

**Decision Required:**
1. Next steps in tariff policy (escalate, hold, or reduce)
2. Compensation programs for affected U.S. industries
3. Allied coordination strategy
4. Negotiation approach with China
5. Long-term trade policy toward China (managed decoupling, phase agreement, or full normalization)

**Key Questions:**
1. Are tariffs achieving stated objectives (changing Chinese behavior, protecting U.S. industry)?
2. How much economic pain is acceptable to achieve trade policy goals?
3. What would constitute a "win" that justifies declaring success and de-escalating?

### Phase 4: Debrief (Minutes 70-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Effectiveness:** Did tariffs effectively coerce China or primarily impose mutual costs?
2. **Escalation Dynamics:** What drove escalation? Could spiral have been prevented?
3. **Domestic Politics:** How did interest group politics shape trade policy options?
4. **Allied Coordination:** Why is unified Western trade policy difficult to achieve?
5. **Alternatives:** Could negotiation, multilateral pressure, or targeted sectoral approaches achieve better outcomes?
6. **Long-term Impacts:** Effects on U.S.-China economic relationship, global trade system, WTO legitimacy?

## Background Materials

**Authorities:**
