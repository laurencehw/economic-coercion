# Tabletop Exercise: Multi-Domain Crisis in 2030

**Chapter:** 10 - Future Scenarios and Policy Implications

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Anticipate emerging forms of economic coercion using future technologies
- Manage simultaneous crises across multiple domains (cyber, space, economic, climate)
- Evaluate novel policy tools for 21st century geoeconomic competition
- Assess systemic risks and cascade effects in interconnected global systems

## Scenario Overview

**Date: June 2030**

The United States faces an unprecedented multi-domain crisis as tensions with China escalate across economic, technological, and environmental spheres. Unlike historical crises centered on single events or domains, this challenge involves simultaneous pressure across interconnected systems, creating cascading risks and novel policy dilemmas.

The crisis unfolds across five interrelated dimensions:
1. **Climate:** Extreme weather disrupts critical supply chains
2. **Digital:** Cyber attacks target economic infrastructure
3. **Space:** Anti-satellite weapons threaten GPS and communications
4. **Financial:** Digital currency warfare and payment system fragmentation
5. **Biotech:** Synthetic biology enabling new forms of coercion

You are convened as the Strategic Competition Policy Committee to manage escalating tensions and develop integrated response strategies for 21st century economic statecraft.

## Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Climate-Supply Chain Nexus (Minutes 0-20)

**Inject 1: Green Technology Chokepoint**

Catastrophic flooding in southern China (climate change-amplified typhoon) damages critical infrastructure for:
- 60% of global solar panel production (primarily Xinjiang region)
- 70% of rare earth processing facilities
- Major EV battery component manufacturing

Global green energy transition suddenly faces 12-18 month delays. Prices for solar panels, batteries, and critical minerals spike 300-400%.

**Chinese Response:**
China announces "Climate Emergency Resource Allocation System":
- Prioritizes clean energy exports to "climate cooperation partners"
- Countries supporting U.S. climate technology export controls to China face reduced access
- Offers climate finance and technology access in exchange for diplomatic concessions on Taiwan, South China Sea

**Complicated Dynamics:**
- U.S. needs Chinese green technology for climate targets
- China uses climate emergency to gain geopolitical leverage
- Global South countries caught between U.S. and Chinese climate offers

**Key Questions:**
1. Should climate cooperation be conditioned on Chinese political behavior, or are climate stakes too high?
2. How do you build alternative green technology supply chains when China dominates and climate timeline is urgent?
3. Can the U.S. use climate finance and technology sharing as counter-coercion tool?

### Phase 2: Digital Currency Warfare (Minutes 20-40)

**Inject 2: Payment System Fragmentation**

China accelerates digital yuan internationalization following coordination with Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia:
- **BRICS+ Digital Currency Network:** New payment system for 40+ countries (40% global GDP)
- **Commodity-backed settlement:** Oil, gas, minerals priced in digital currency basket
- **Alternative to SWIFT:** Real-time cross-border payments bypassing dollar system

Simultaneously:
- Several countries announce plans to hold digital yuan reserves
- China offers preferential trade financing for digital yuan users
- Crypto-based payment systems gain traction for sanctions evasion

**U.S. Financial System Impact:**
- Dollar's share of global reserves declines from 58% to 50% in six months
- Treasury market volatility as foreign holdings decline
- Reduced effectiveness of financial sanctions as alternatives proliferate

**Fed and Treasury Assessment:**
- U.S. digital dollar 2+ years from implementation
- Banning competing digital currencies likely drives them underground
- Financial sanctions losing potency as alternative systems mature

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you respond to emerging payment system competition: accelerate U.S. digital dollar, restrict alternatives, or accept multipolar financial system?
2. Can financial sanctions remain effective when targets have viable alternatives?
3. Should U.S. prioritize preserving dollar dominance or gracefully manage transition to multipolar system?

### Phase 3: Cyber-Physical Systems Attack (Minutes 40-60)

**Inject 3: Infrastructure Cascade**

A sophisticated cyber attack (attribution unclear but suspected Chinese origin) targets U.S. critical infrastructure:
- **Power Grid:** Malware disrupts renewable energy systems (solar, wind) causing grid instability
- **Logistics:** Port automation systems compromised; cargo routing chaos
- **Financial:** Clearing systems for equities and derivatives experience delays
- **Telecommunications:** 5G networks experience intermittent outages

Attack exploits vulnerabilities in:
- Internet of Things (IoT) devices manufactured in China
- Software supply chains with compromised open-source components
- AI-powered infrastructure management systems

**Cascading Effects:**
- Economic losses: $50 billion+ in first week
- Public panic: Bank runs, hoarding behavior
- Political pressure: Demands for retaliation

**Attribution Challenge:**
- Attack routed through multiple countries
- Malware includes code fragments from multiple sources
- China denies involvement; suggests "criminal actors"
- No definitive proof of state sponsorship

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you respond to catastrophic cyber attack without certain attribution?
2. What constitutes proportional cyber retaliation, and what escalation risks does it create?
3. How do you secure cyber-physical infrastructure when supply chains are globally interdependent?

### Phase 4: Space and Biotech Dimensions (Minutes 60-80)

**Inject 4: Anti-Satellite Demonstration**

China conducts "debris removal test" using anti-satellite capability, destroying defunct satellite near U.S. GPS constellation. While technically targeting space junk, the demonstration:
- Proves Chinese capability to disable U.S. space infrastructure
- Creates debris field threatening commercial satellites
- Sends message: "Your precision-guided weapons, financial systems, and communications depend on space assets we can threaten"

Simultaneously, Chinese space station begins commercial operations offering:
- Manufacturing in zero-gravity (advanced materials)
- Earth observation services competing with U.S. commercial satellites
- Space-based solar power research (potential energy revolution)

**Inject 5: Synthetic Biology Leverage**

Intelligence reveals Chinese biotech advances:
- CRISPR-based agricultural technology creating drought/pest-resistant crops
- Synthetic biology for rare molecule production (pharmaceutical precursors, industrial chemicals)
- Genetic database containing genomic information on billions of individuals

China offers:
- Agricultural technology to climate-vulnerable countries (creating dependencies)
- Pharmaceutical precursor access based on political alignment
- Genomic research collaboration (with data sharing requirements)

**Strategic Implications:**
- Biotech creates novel forms of leverage (food security, medicine access, genetic information)
- Space denial capabilities threaten entire infrastructure domains
- U.S. lacks comparable biotech leverage or space resilience

**Decision Required:** Integrated strategy addressing:
1. **Immediate crisis management:** Cyber response, infrastructure resilience, market stabilization
2. **Domain-specific strategies:** Climate/green tech, digital currency, cyber security, space, biotech
3. **Cross-cutting approaches:** Supply chain resilience, technology controls, allied coordination
4. **Escalation management:** Preventing crisis spiral across multiple domains simultaneously
5. **Long-term adaptation:** How to compete in multi-domain strategic environment

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you prioritize when crises span multiple domains simultaneously?
2. What new policy tools are needed for emerging technologies (digital currency, synthetic biology, space commerce)?
3. How do you build resilience against novel coercion forms you haven't encountered before?
4. Can traditional frameworks (sanctions, export controls) adapt to decentralized, rapidly evolving technologies?

### Phase 5: Debrief and Future Policy (Minutes 80-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Multi-Domain Complexity:** How did simultaneous crises across domains complicate decision-making? What coordination mechanisms are needed?

2. **Novel Coercion Forms:** Which emerging technologies (digital currency, synthetic biology, space, AI, quantum) create new coercion opportunities? How do you defend against threats you've never faced?

3. **Interconnection Vulnerabilities:** How do cascading effects across interconnected systems (cyber-physical, climate-economic, space-terrestrial) create systemic risks?

4. **Policy Tool Adequacy:** Are existing tools (sanctions, export controls, investment screening) sufficient for future competition? What new authorities or capabilities are needed?

5. **Resilience vs. Leverage:** Should strategy emphasize building resilience (reducing dependencies) or developing counter-leverage (new chokepoints)?

6. **Cooperation vs. Competition:** In domains requiring cooperation (climate, pandemics, space debris), how do you cooperate with strategic competitors?

7. **Scenario Planning:** What other future scenarios should policymakers prepare for:
   - Quantum computing breaking encryption
   - Artificial general intelligence (AGI) breakthroughs
   - Climate tipping points forcing cooperation
   - Global economic decoupling into blocs
   - Proliferation of autonomous weapons

8. **Adaptation Strategy:** How should U.S. policy evolve to address 2030s challenges:
   - Institutional reforms (new agencies, authorities)?
   - Allied coordination mechanisms?
   - Public-private partnerships?
   - Technology investment and development?
   - Education and workforce development?
