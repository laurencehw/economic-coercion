# Tabletop Exercise: Critical Minerals Crisis and Supply Disruption

**Chapter:** 3 - Critical Sectors and Strategic Resources

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Analyze vulnerabilities created by concentrated control of critical minerals
- Evaluate tools for building strategic reserves and diversifying supply sources
- Understand environmental, economic, and geopolitical trade-offs in resource security
- Assess effectiveness of retaliation and counter-coercion in resource conflicts

## Scenario Overview

**Date: June 2027**

Following a U.S. decision to impose new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and solar panels under Section 301, China announces "temporary export controls" on gallium, germanium, and several rare earth elements "for national security reasons." The measures require Chinese exporters to obtain licenses for shipments to "unfriendly countries," which in practice means the United States and allies supporting the tariffs.

China produces 98% of global gallium, 60% of germanium, and dominates rare earth processing (85%+ global capacity). These materials are critical for:
- **Defense:** Missile guidance systems, radar, satellite communications, night vision equipment
- **Clean energy:** Wind turbines, electric vehicle motors, solar panels
- **Electronics:** Smartphones, fiber optics, semiconductors, LED lighting

Within two weeks, U.S. defense contractors report critical shortfalls. Prices for available gallium spike 400%. Major renewable energy projects face delays. The Pentagon warns that missile production and F-35 maintenance could be affected within 3-6 months.

Allied reactions are mixed: Japan and Australia support U.S. tariffs but need rare earth access; the EU opposes tariffs and seeks separate accommodation with China. Several African and Latin American countries with potential rare earth deposits are courting both U.S. and Chinese investment.

You are convened as an interagency task force to develop immediate responses and long-term critical mineral security strategy.

## Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Immediate Supply Crisis (Minutes 0-20)

**Inject 1: Defense Production at Risk**

Pentagon assessment shows:
- Raytheon: 4-month supply of gallium for missile production; will halt new production within 90 days
- Lockheed Martin: F-35 maintenance requires rare earth magnets; current stockpile lasts 6 months
- Northrop Grumman: Satellite systems require germanium; limited alternatives
- General Dynamics: Night vision equipment production affected immediately

Defense contractors request:
1. Emergency release of Defense National Stockpile materials
2. Defense Production Act authority to prioritize their access to global supplies
3. Relaxation of export controls to source from any available supplier (including Russian or Iranian intermediaries)

**Key Questions:**
1. Should the U.S. immediately release strategic stockpile materials, even though current stocks are limited and building new reserves could take years?
2. Do you prioritize defense over clean energy industries for available rare earth supplies?
3. Should the U.S. retaliate with its own export controls on critical goods where it has leverage (e.g., specialized equipment, agricultural products)?

### Phase 2: Allied Divergence and Alternative Sources (Minutes 20-45)

**Inject 2: Allied Fragmentation**

- **Japan:** Proposes joint U.S.-Japan rare earth stockpile but requests U.S. share costs; has some existing stockpiles
- **Australia:** Willing to accelerate Lynas rare earth production but needs $2 billion U.S. investment and technology transfers; production increase takes 18-24 months
- **EU:** Refuses to join any counter-measures against China; negotiating separate rare earth supply agreement with Beijing
- **South Korea:** Caught between U.S. alliance and economic dependence on China; seeking to stay neutral

**Inject 3: Problematic Alternative Sources**

Several alternative supply options emerge, all with complications:

- **Myanmar:** Has rare earth deposits but controlled by military junta under U.S. sanctions; Chinese firms already operating there
- **Greenland:** Rare earth deposits available but Denmark/Greenland hesitant due to environmental concerns and Chinese influence
- **Central Asia:** Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have deposits but require massive infrastructure investment and have close Russia/China ties
- **Democratic Republic of Congo:** Cobalt and some rare earths available but severe governance, human rights, and environmental concerns
- **Domestic (California, Alaska):** Mountain Pass mine could increase production but faces environmental lawsuits; expansion requires 2-3 years and $500 million+

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you balance speed (sourcing from problematic suppliers) versus values (human rights, environment, sanctions compliance)?
2. What investments should the U.S. make in alternative sources, knowing they won't help the immediate crisis?
3. How do you coordinate with allies who have different interests and China dependencies?

### Phase 3: Strategic Decisions and Escalation Risk (Minutes 45-70)

**Inject 4: China Escalates**

Intelligence reports that China is:
- Offering long-term rare earth contracts to European firms if they oppose U.S. tariffs
- Increasing rare earth shipments to Russia and Iran as geopolitical favor
- Restricting neodymium (critical for EV motors) to pressure U.S. auto industry
- Using rare earth leverage to demand U.S. remove sanctions on specific Chinese tech firms

Chinese state media declares that "those who seek to contain China will find their own development contained."

**Inject 5: Domestic Political Pressure**

- **Defense industry:** Demands government action; warns of military readiness gaps
- **Clean energy sector:** Warns that wind and EV production will collapse; blames administration's China policy for crisis
- **Environmental groups:** Oppose fast-tracking domestic mining; file lawsuits against emergency permits
- **Labor unions:** Support domestic mining for jobs but demand environmental and safety protections
- **Congress:** Bipartisan criticism; hearings scheduled; legislation proposed to mandate domestic rare earth production

**Decision Required:** Long-term critical minerals strategy including:
1. Immediate crisis mitigation (stockpile release, emergency imports, rationing)
2. Medium-term diversification (investments in alternative sources, allied coordination)
3. Long-term self-reliance (domestic production, recycling, substitution R&D)
4. Response to Chinese coercion (retaliation, accommodation, or de-escalation)
5. Policy reforms (permitting, environmental regulations, subsidies, strategic reserves)

**Key Questions:**
1. How much economic cost and environmental compromise is acceptable to achieve critical mineral security?
2. Should the U.S. retaliate with its own export controls, knowing this escalates economic conflict?
3. What is the right balance between domestic production (slow, expensive, environmental concerns) and diversified imports (faster but still creates dependencies)?
4. How do you structure long-term contracts and investments to ensure supply reliability?

### Phase 4: Debrief and Analysis (Minutes 70-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Vulnerability Assessment:** How did concentrated Chinese control of rare earths create coercive leverage? Could this vulnerability have been reduced earlier?

2. **Resilience vs. Cost:** Domestic rare earth production is 2-3x more expensive than Chinese supply. How do you justify taxpayer and consumer costs for supply security?

3. **Environmental Trade-offs:** Rare earth mining and processing create environmental damage. How did you balance environmental protection against resource security?

4. **Allied Coordination:** Why was allied unity difficult? How could burden-sharing be structured to align incentives?

5. **Retaliation Calculus:** If the U.S. retaliates with its own export controls, does this escalate toward economic decoupling? What are the risks and benefits?

6. **Long-term Strategy:** What mix of stockpiling, diversification, domestic production, recycling, and substitution research is optimal?

7. **Unintended Consequences:**
   - Impact on clean energy transition if rare earths become scarce/expensive
   - Chinese response to U.S. efforts to reduce dependence
   - Environmental and indigenous community impacts of accelerated mining
   - Precedent for future resource weapon ization

8. **China's Perspective:** From Beijing's viewpoint, why use rare earths as leverage? What does this reveal about Chinese strategic thinking?

## Background Materials

**Key Authorities:**
- Defense Production Act, 50 U.S.C. § 4501 et seq.
- Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, 50 U.S.C. § 98 et seq.
- Energy Act of 2020 (critical minerals provisions)
- Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (rare earth programs)

**Critical Mineral Data:**
- Chinese rare earth production: 60% of mining, 85%+ of processing
- U.S. imports: 80% of rare earth elements from China (2019)
- Defense uses: $500 million+ annually in rare earths for weapons systems
- Clean energy: Each wind turbine requires ~500 kg of rare earths; each EV motor ~1-2 kg
- Price volatility: Previous Chinese restrictions (2010-2011) caused 10x price spikes

**Alternative Sources:**
- U.S. domestic: Mountain Pass (California) only operating mine; several deposits in Alaska, Wyoming
- Australia: Lynas Corporation, second-largest rare earth processor
- Greenland: Kvanefjeld deposit, politically sensitive
- Recycling: Currently <1% of rare earths recycled; technology improving

**Recent Precedents:**
- 2010 Japan-China rare earth dispute following Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands incident
- July 2023 China export controls on gallium and germanium
- U.S. government studies identifying rare earths as critical vulnerability (2017, 2019, 2021)

## Facilitator Notes

**Setup:**
- Provide simple chart showing rare earth supply chain (mining → processing → manufacturing)
- Have participants review basics of rare earth uses before exercise
- Consider field trip video or images of rare earth mining environmental impacts

**Time Management:**
- Phase 1: Focus on immediate triage and prioritization
- Phase 2: Emphasize difficult trade-offs (speed vs. values, cost vs. security)
- Phase 3: Force concrete recommendations with budgets and timelines
- Phase 4: Extract lessons about resource dependencies and strategic competition

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Assuming domestic production can quickly replace imports (takes 5-10 years minimum)
- Underestimating environmental obstacles to mining expansion
- Treating "alternative sources" as fungible (each has unique political/technical issues)
- Neglecting clean energy impacts (delays renewable deployment)

**Extension Options:**
- Add simultaneous crisis in another critical mineral (lithium, cobalt)
- Include China offering to negotiate if U.S. makes concessions on Taiwan
- Simulate environmental lawsuit halting expedited mining permits
- Add competing demands from private sector for rare earths (tech vs. defense vs. energy)
