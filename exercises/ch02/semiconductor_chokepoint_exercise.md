# Tabletop Exercise: Semiconductor Chokepoint Crisis

**Chapter:** 2 - Supply Chain Vulnerabilities and Dependencies

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Analyze chokepoint vulnerabilities in global supply chains
- Evaluate tools for supply chain resilience and diversification
- Understand trade-offs between economic efficiency and strategic autonomy
- Assess effectiveness of export controls and investment restrictions in protecting critical supply chains

## Scenario Overview

**Date: March 2027**

A major earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale strikes central Taiwan, causing significant damage to infrastructure in Hsinchu Science Park, home to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and dozens of supporting firms. While TSMC's advanced fabs have earthquake protection, several critical facilities suffer damage that will take 4-6 months to fully repair. TSMC announces that production of advanced 3nm and 5nm chips will be reduced by approximately 40% for at least four months.

Global markets react with panic. Within 48 hours, major automotive manufacturers announce production slowdowns due to anticipated chip shortages. Apple, NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm stocks drop 15-20%. The White House receives urgent calls from industry leaders requesting government intervention.

Simultaneously, intelligence reports indicate that China is considering using this crisis as a "window of opportunity" to pressure Taiwan, potentially by offering emergency semiconductor supplies in exchange for political concessions. Chinese state media emphasizes that "the reunification of the motherland would prevent such vulnerabilities."

You are members of the National Economic Council and National Security Council convened to develop both immediate crisis response and longer-term supply chain resilience strategies.

## Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Immediate Crisis (Minutes 0-20)

**Inject 1: Supply Chain Assessment**

Initial assessments indicate:
- Apple: 60% of advanced chips sourced from damaged facilities; iPhone production at risk
- Auto industry: Already fragile chip supplies; this will force plant closures within weeks
- Defense contractors: Weapons systems requiring advanced chips face delays
- Data center operators: AI chip shortages will slow cloud infrastructure expansion

TSMC requests U.S. assistance with specialized equipment and materials to accelerate repairs. Japanese and Dutch lithography equipment manufacturers are offering expedited support, but Chinese firms are offering immediate alternative production capacity at older nodes.

**Key Questions:**
1. What immediate steps should the U.S. government take to manage the crisis: emergency CHIPS Act funding, Defense Production Act authorities, diplomatic coordination?
2. Should the U.S. encourage or discourage firms from using Chinese alternative production capacity?
3. How do you balance market forces (allowing firms to source chips wherever available) against security concerns (preventing Chinese leverage over U.S. tech industry)?

### Phase 2: Chinese Pressure and Allied Divergence (Minutes 20-45)

**Inject 2: China's Strategic Offer**

China's government announces an emergency program offering to prioritize semiconductor production for "Chinese and friendly markets" to compensate for Taiwan's disruption. Chinese state-owned firms contact major U.S. tech companies offering guaranteed chip supplies for the next 12 months at favorable prices.

Taiwan's government reports that Beijing has quietly communicated that "unnecessary tensions and provocations" could affect China's willingness to provide economic assistance during Taiwan's recovery. Intelligence suggests China may be preparing to restrict rare earth exports needed for semiconductor manufacturing as additional leverage.

**Inject 3: Allied Semiconductor Competition**

- **South Korea:** Samsung announces major production expansion but prioritizes Korean and European customers; hints that U.S. export control cooperation depends on preferential access
- **Japan:** Willing to expedite equipment to Taiwan but requests U.S. reconsider restrictions on Japanese firms selling to Chinese customers
- **EU:** Announces €20 billion emergency semiconductor fund; Commissioner publicly criticizes U.S. "America First" semiconductor policy

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you prevent Chinese economic leverage over U.S. firms without driving them to bankruptcy?
2. What incentives or requirements should accompany any government assistance to industry?
3. How do you coordinate with allies who have competing semiconductor ambitions?

### Phase 3: Long-Term Strategy Decision (Minutes 45-70)

**Inject 4: Strategic Choices**

Intelligence assessment projects:
- TSMC Taiwan recovery: 4-6 months to 80% capacity, 12-18 months to full capacity
- China accelerating indigenous semiconductor development; may achieve 7nm production within 2 years
- U.S. domestic fab construction (CHIPS Act funded): Still 2-3 years from volume production

Industry coalition proposes:
1. $50 billion emergency fund for domestic fab acceleration
2. Waiver of certain environmental reviews to speed construction
3. Government-backed insurance for semiconductor supply disruptions
4. Relaxation of export controls to allow U.S. firms to maintain Chinese market share

National security team proposes:
1. Mandatory supply chain diversification requirements for critical industries
2. Stricter export controls to prevent any advanced technology reaching China
3. Strategic reserve of critical semiconductors (similar to oil reserve)
4. Accelerated TSMC Arizona production even at higher costs

**Inject 5: Taiwan Vulnerability**

Taiwan's president publicly states that the earthquake demonstrates the need for international support for Taiwan's security, linking semiconductor supply reliability to Taiwan's political status. This draws sharp Chinese condemnation and veiled military threats.

U.S. firms express concern that overly politicizing semiconductors will damage business relationships and innovation ecosystems. Some suggest the U.S. should separate economic and security issues to maintain industry competitiveness.

**Decision Required:** Recommendations for:
1. Immediate crisis mitigation (0-6 months)
2. Medium-term resilience building (1-3 years)
3. Long-term supply chain restructuring (3-10 years)
4. Policy toward China's semiconductor industry and firms using Chinese capacity
5. Allied coordination and burden-sharing

**Key Questions:**
1. How much economic inefficiency and cost is acceptable to achieve supply chain security?
2. Should the government mandate private sector behavior (e.g., prohibit using Chinese chips) or rely on incentives?
3. What is the right balance between allied diversification (Europe, Japan, Korea) and domestic reshoring?
4. How do you handle the tension between maintaining U.S. semiconductor competitiveness and denying China access to advanced technology?

### Phase 4: Debrief and Analysis (Minutes 70-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Chokepoint Vulnerability:** What made Taiwan semiconductors such a critical chokepoint? Could this vulnerability have been reduced through prior policy choices?

2. **Resilience vs. Efficiency:** How did you balance the economic costs of diversification/reshoring against security benefits? What metrics should guide this trade-off?

3. **Private Sector Coordination:** How did you align private sector incentives (profitability, market share) with national security objectives? Were mandates or incentives more effective?

4. **Allied Coordination:** Why is coordinating semiconductor policy among allies difficult? How did you structure burden-sharing?

5. **China Strategic Leverage:** How did you prevent China from using the crisis to gain leverage over Taiwan or U.S. firms? Did your approach reduce or increase long-term Chinese leverage?

6. **Unintended Consequences:** What second-order effects might your policies create:
   - Impact on U.S. tech industry innovation and competitiveness
   - Chinese response (accelerated self-reliance, retaliation)
   - Allied relations and trust
   - Global semiconductor market structure

7. **Timeframe Mismatches:** How did you manage the gap between immediate needs (chips now), medium-term buildout (2-3 years), and long-term restructuring (5-10 years)?
