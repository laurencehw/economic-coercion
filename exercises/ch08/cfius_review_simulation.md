# Tabletop Exercise: CFIUS Review and Investment Screening Dilemmas

**Chapter:** 8 - Investment Screening, Industrial Policy, and Strategic Assets

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply CFIUS framework to assess national security risks of foreign investments
- Evaluate trade-offs between security and economic openness
- Understand sectoral and technology-based investment risks
- Navigate political pressure and interagency disagreement in investment screening

## Scenario Overview

**Date: July 2028**

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) faces three simultaneous high-profile cases requiring urgent decisions. Each involves Chinese investment in U.S. companies with potential national security implications but also significant economic consequences:

**Case 1:** Chinese semiconductor equipment firm seeks to acquire 40% stake in U.S. precision machinery company that supplies components used in advanced chip manufacturing

**Case 2:** Chinese private equity fund (with state-owned enterprise investors) proposes $2 billion investment in U.S. agricultural biotechnology company developing gene-editing technology

**Case 3:** Chinese electric vehicle battery company wants to build $5 billion manufacturing facility in Michigan, creating 2,000 jobs in economically distressed region

All three transactions have been voluntarily filed with CFIUS. You must decide: approve, approve with mitigation measures, or block each transaction. Congressional and industry pressure is intense. Presidential decision required within 30 days.

## Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Case 1 - Semiconductor Equipment (Minutes 0-25)

**Inject 1: Transaction Details**

Chinese firm "TechPrecision Industries" offers $800 million for 40% stake in "AmeriMachine Inc." (based in California, 500 employees). AmeriMachine produces ultra-precision CNC machines used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

**Due Diligence Findings:**
- TechPrecision has contracts with Chinese government entities
- AmeriMachine technology is dual-use (also used in aerospace, defense)
- Several AmeriMachine executives are former DOD contractors
- Chinese investors would gain board seats and access to R&D
- No direct U.S. government contracts, but supplies companies that have them

**Intelligence Assessment:**
- TechPrecision likely has ties to Chinese military-civil fusion programs
- Technology could enhance Chinese semiconductor manufacturing capabilities
- Risk of technology diversion to Chinese military applications

**Economic Impact:**
- AmeriMachine struggling financially; needs capital injection
- Alternative investors (U.S., EU, Japan) offering less money with more conditions
- 500 jobs at risk if company cannot secure financing

**Industry Position:**
- U.S. semiconductor firms oppose (fear strengthening Chinese capabilities)
- Some equipment manufacturers support (want access to Chinese market)

**Key Questions:**
1. Does this transaction present unacceptable national security risk?
2. Are mitigation measures (e.g., board restrictions, technology access limits, compliance monitoring) sufficient?
3. How do you balance AmeriMachine's financial needs against technology protection?

### Phase 2: Case 2 - Agricultural Biotechnology (Minutes 25-50)

**Inject 2: Transaction Details**

Chinese private equity fund "Golden Harvest Capital" proposes $2 billion investment in "GenAg Sciences" (based in Iowa), acquiring 35% stake. GenAg develops CRISPR gene-editing technology for crop improvement.

**Due Diligence Findings:**
- Golden Harvest's largest investors include Chinese state-owned enterprises
- GenAg technology has applications for food security (China's concern)
- Technology could enhance biological research capabilities
- GenAg holds sensitive genomic data from U.S. agricultural regions
- Chinese investors request rights to license technology in Asia

**Intelligence Assessment:**
- China prioritizes agricultural biotechnology for food security
- Potential dual-use for biological weapons research (low probability but catastrophic impact)
- Concern about Chinese access to U.S. genomic and agricultural data
- China's military-civil fusion could redirect civilian technology

**Economic Impact:**
- GenAg needs capital for R&D and commercialization
- Investment would accelerate development of drought-resistant crops (beneficial globally)
- Iowa governor and Congressional delegation strongly support (jobs, rural development)
- U.S. agricultural sector split (some fear Chinese biotech dominance)

**Political Pressure:**
- Senator from Iowa threatens to block administration nominees if deal blocked
- Bioethics community concerned about genomic data transfers
- Farm lobby supports investment as opening Chinese market access

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you assess dual-use risks of biotechnology versus traditional defense technology?
2. Should genomic data and agricultural IP be treated as national security assets?
3. Are concerns about Chinese food security motivations legitimate or cover for military applications?

### Phase 3: Case 3 - EV Battery Manufacturing (Minutes 50-75)

**Inject 3: Transaction Details**

"ChargeTech Industries" (Chinese battery manufacturer) proposes $5 billion greenfield investment building EV battery gigafactory in Detroit area. No U.S. company acquisition; purely new facility construction.

**Due Diligence Findings:**
- ChargeTech is private company but receives Chinese government subsidies
- Facility would produce batteries for U.S. automakers (Tesla, Ford, GM)
- Technology involves proprietary Chinese battery chemistry and manufacturing processes
- Plant would employ 2,000 workers in economically distressed region
- Chinese firm requests access to U.S. grid infrastructure and rare earth supply chains

**Intelligence Assessment:**
- Minimal direct national security risk (consumer EV batteries)
- Potential supply chain dependencies if future U.S. automakers rely on Chinese supplier
- Facility could collect data on U.S. energy infrastructure and logistics
- China could use facility as leverage in future crises (threaten shutdown)

**Economic Impact:**
- Massive economic benefit to Detroit region ($5 billion investment, 2,000 direct jobs, 5,000+ indirect)
- Accelerates U.S. EV transition (climate benefits)
- Reduces need to import Chinese batteries
- But creates dependency on Chinese firm for critical U.S. industry

**Political Pressure:**
- Michigan governor and Congressional delegation demand approval
- Labor unions support (jobs)
- Environmental groups support (EV transition)
- Some manufacturing groups oppose (subsidized Chinese competition)
- Energy Department concerned about grid infrastructure access

**Key Questions:**
1. Does greenfield investment (new facility, not acquisition) present different security risks?
2. How do you weigh job creation and climate benefits against supply chain dependency risks?
3. Can mitigation measures (e.g., restricting infrastructure access, requiring U.S. sourcing) address concerns?

### Phase 4: Synthesis and Recommendations (Minutes 75-90)

**Decision Required:** For each case, recommend:
1. Approve
2. Approve with mitigation measures (specify)
3. Block/divest

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Risk Assessment Framework:** How did you distinguish acceptable from unacceptable national security risks across different sectors?

2. **Mitigation Effectiveness:** When are mitigation measures sufficient versus inadequate? How enforceable are they?

3. **Economic Trade-offs:** How did you balance security risks against economic benefits (jobs, capital, innovation)?

4. **Political Pressure:** How did you handle Congressional and state-level pressure? Should CFIUS be insulated from politics?

5. **Consistency:** Were your decisions consistent across the three cases? What principles guided trade-offs?

6. **Sectoral Differences:** Should some sectors (semiconductors, biotech, energy) receive different scrutiny levels?

7. **Alternatives to Blocking:**
   - Could U.S. provide alternative financing to reduce Chinese investment need?
   - Are there coalition investment models (allies pool capital) to replace Chinese investors?

8. **Long-term Strategy:** Impact on U.S. as investment destination? Will aggressive screening drive capital elsewhere?
