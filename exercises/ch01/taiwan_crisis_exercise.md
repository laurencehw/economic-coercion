# Tabletop Exercise: Taiwan Strait Economic Coercion Crisis

**Chapter:** 1 - Foundations of Economic Statecraft in the 21st Century

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply the framework of economic coercion (tools, targets, objectives, effectiveness) to a realistic crisis scenario
- Analyze trade-offs between economic leverage, allied coordination, and escalation risks
- Understand how Chinese and U.S. perspectives on sovereignty and economic interdependence shape crisis responses
- Evaluate the effectiveness of different economic statecraft tools in a high-stakes environment

## Scenario Overview

**Date: January 15, 2026**

Taiwan's newly elected president has announced plans to pursue formal constitutional changes that Beijing views as steps toward de jure independence. In response, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has initiated large-scale military exercises encircling Taiwan, including a partial naval blockade that disrupts commercial shipping. China has not declared war but characterizes the exercises as "internal law enforcement operations."

The United States faces pressure from Taiwan, Japan, and other Indo-Pacific allies to respond with both security guarantees and economic measures. However, the U.S.-China economic relationship remains deeply intertwined: China holds $850 billion in U.S. Treasury securities, bilateral trade exceeds $700 billion annually, and U.S. firms depend on Chinese supply chains for critical inputs. China, meanwhile, remains dependent on Taiwan for advanced semiconductors, U.S. semiconductor equipment, and access to Western financial systems.

You are members of the National Security Council Deputies Committee convened to develop economic response options for the President. The crisis is escalating, and decisions made in the next 48-72 hours may determine whether the situation resolves diplomatically, escalates to comprehensive economic warfare, or spirals into military conflict.

## Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Initial Crisis Response (Minutes 0-20)

**Inject 1: Blockade Tightens**

China announces that all vessels approaching Taiwan must receive approval from Chinese maritime authorities. Three commercial cargo ships are turned away. Taiwan reports that PLA Navy vessels are stopping and inspecting merchant ships in international waters. Japan and South Korea express concern that their trade with Taiwan (including critical semiconductor imports) is being disrupted.

**Intelligence Assessment:** China appears to be implementing a "quarantine" rather than a full blockade, claiming authority to inspect vessels for military materials. However, the practical effect is severe disruption to Taiwan's trade. Beijing has mobilized economic ministries to implement potential counter-coercion against countries supporting Taiwan.

**Key Questions:**
1. Should the U.S. immediately announce economic sanctions, or wait to coordinate with allies?
2. Which economic tools provide the most leverage with acceptable escalation risk: financial sanctions, export controls, trade restrictions, or a combination?
3. How do you balance signaling resolve to Taiwan and allies against avoiding steps that make Chinese de-escalation politically impossible?

### Phase 2: Allied Coordination and Chinese Threats (Minutes 20-45)

**Inject 2: Allied Discord**

Japan signals willingness to join coordinated sanctions but requests exemptions for energy imports from China. South Korea is hesitant, fearing Chinese economic retaliation against its auto and electronics exports. The EU issues a statement condemning the blockade but takes no concrete action. Taiwan urgently requests that the U.S. freeze Chinese assets and ban semiconductor equipment exports to China.

**Inject 3: Chinese Counter-Threats**

China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson warns that "countries interfering in China's internal affairs will face resolute countermeasures." Reports indicate China is preparing to:
- Restrict rare earth exports to the U.S. and allies
- Launch investigations into U.S. firms under Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law
- Reduce purchases of U.S. Treasury securities
- Ban U.S. agricultural imports
- Cut off supply of critical pharmaceutical precursors

**Key Questions:**
1. How important is multilateral coordination, and are you willing to delay action to achieve it?
2. How do you assess the credibility of Chinese counter-coercion threats, and how would Chinese retaliation affect the U.S. economy and political sustainability of sanctions?
3. Should the U.S. implement "defensive" economic measures (e.g., diversifying supply chains, building stockpiles) before imposing sanctions on China?

### Phase 3: Escalation and Decision Point (Minutes 45-70)

**Inject 4: Maritime Incident**

A U.S. Navy destroyer conducting a freedom of navigation operation is "painted" by Chinese targeting radar. No shots are fired, but tensions spike. The PLA announces an expanded military exercise zone that effectively closes the Taiwan Strait to commercial traffic.

Taiwan's president appeals directly to the U.S. President for "meaningful economic consequences" for China's actions. Domestic political pressure is mounting: both hawkish members of Congress and U.S. business groups are calling for action, though with very different recommendations.

**Inject 5: Semiconductor Leverage**

Taiwan's government indicates it is considering halting semiconductor exports to China (which would cripple Chinese tech industry) if the U.S. and allies take strong economic action. However, this would also disrupt global supply chains and harm TSMC's business model. China has reportedly put Chinese firms on notice to reduce dependencies on U.S. technology, accelerating indigenous semiconductor development regardless of cost.

**Decision Required:** The President needs recommendations within 24 hours on:
1. Which economic measures to implement, if any
2. Conditions for reversing those measures
3. Coordination strategy with allies
4. Mitigation of likely Chinese counter-coercion
5. Off-ramps for de-escalation

**Key Questions:**
1. Do you recommend comprehensive sanctions (SWIFT exclusion, asset freezes, export controls) or calibrated measures (targeted sanctions, limited export controls)?
2. What objectives are realistic: compelling China to end the blockade (compellence), deterring future aggression (deterrence), or degrading Chinese capabilities (denial)?
3. How do you sequence economic measures to preserve escalation options while signaling resolve?
4. What intelligence would change your assessment, and how do you hedge against uncertainty about Chinese decision-making?

### Phase 4: Debrief and Analysis (Minutes 70-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Effectiveness Assessment:** Which economic tools provided the most leverage relative to costs? What made certain tools more or less effective?

2. **Allied Coordination:** How did divergent allied interests affect your strategy? Could you have structured measures to accommodate allied concerns while maintaining pressure?

3. **Chinese Perspective:** How might Chinese leaders interpret different U.S. actions? Which measures would Beijing view as crossing red lines versus acceptable responses?

4. **Escalation Dynamics:** Did economic coercion reduce or increase the risk of military conflict? How do you prevent an economic spiral that makes diplomatic off-ramps impossible?

5. **Second-Order Effects:** What long-term consequences would your chosen measures create for:
   - U.S.-China economic relationship
   - Dollar's role in international finance
   - Allied trust in U.S. leadership
   - Chinese pursuit of economic self-reliance
   - Global economic stability

6. **Domestic Politics:** How sustainable is your chosen approach given U.S. domestic politics, economic interests, and public opinion?

7. **Alternative Scenarios:** How would your recommendations change if:
   - China declared a full military blockade rather than a "quarantine"
   - Taiwan took provocative actions (e.g., declaring independence) that complicated U.S. messaging
   - Russia opened a simultaneous crisis in Europe, dividing U.S. attention and allied commitment

## Background Materials

**Key Authorities:**
- International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. §§ 1701-1708
- Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), 50 U.S.C. App. §§ 1-44
- Export Control Reform Act (ECRA), 50 U.S.C. § 4811 et seq.
- Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), 22 U.S.C. § 3301 et seq.

**Recent Precedents:**
- 2022 Russia SWIFT exclusion and asset freezes
- 2022-2024 semiconductor export controls on China
- 2014 Russia sanctions following Crimea annexation
- 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis

**Economic Data:**
- U.S.-China bilateral trade: $700+ billion annually
- Chinese holdings of U.S. Treasuries: ~$850 billion
- Taiwan semiconductor exports to China: ~$140 billion annually
- U.S. imports from China: ~$540 billion annually
- U.S. exports to China: ~$195 billion annually

**Strategic Context:**
- Taiwan Strait is world's most important semiconductor chokepoint (TSMC produces 90% of advanced chips)
- China depends on food imports (80%+ soybean import dependence) but has substantial domestic grain production and reserves
- U.S. remains dependent on Chinese rare earths (80%+ for some critical elements)
- Global shipping: 50%+ of container traffic passes through South China Sea

## Facilitator Notes

**Setup:**
- Assign roles in advance if possible, allowing participants to review background
- Provide one-page role sheets with specific responsibilities and interests
- Have whiteboards or shared documents to track proposed measures and their effects

**Time Management:**
- Phase 1: 20 minutes max - focus on immediate response options
- Phase 2: 25 minutes - emphasize allied coordination challenges and Chinese counter-threats
- Phase 3: 25 minutes - force concrete recommendations
- Phase 4: 20-30 minutes - critical for extracting lessons

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Participants defaulting to military rather than economic tools (redirect to economic focus)
- Unrealistic assumptions about allied unity (emphasize divergent interests)
- Treating Chinese responses as passive (inject credible counter-coercion)
- Neglecting second-order effects and long-term consequences (probe these explicitly)

**Extension Options:**
- Add roles for Chinese decision-makers to simulate red-teaming
- Include a market response inject (stock market crash, dollar volatility)
- Simulate a second iteration 6 months later to evaluate chosen strategy's sustainability

**Variations:**
- For more experienced participants: Add complexity with simultaneous Middle East crisis dividing resources
- For policy focus: Emphasize domestic political constraints and Congressional reactions
- For economics focus: Provide detailed economic modeling of sanctions impact

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this exercise, participants should be able to:

1. **Apply the economic coercion framework** to analyze tools (sanctions, export controls, financial measures), targets (state, firms, individuals), objectives (compellence, deterrence, denial), and effectiveness factors

2. **Evaluate trade-offs** between economic leverage and costs, immediate signaling and long-term sustainability, unilateral action and multilateral coordination

3. **Understand adversary perspectives** on how Chinese leaders might interpret different U.S. actions based on historical experiences and strategic objectives

4. **Assess escalation risks** inherent in weaponizing economic interdependence in a crisis environment

5. **Recognize intelligence gaps and uncertainty** in crisis decision-making about adversary intentions and resolve
