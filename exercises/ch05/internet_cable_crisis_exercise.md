# Tabletop Exercise: Submarine Cable Sabotage and Digital Infrastructure Crisis

**Chapter:** 5 - Information, Standards, and Digital Infrastructure

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Analyze vulnerabilities in global digital infrastructure
- Evaluate information controls as tools of statecraft
- Understand trade-offs between connectivity and security
- Assess attribution challenges and response options to infrastructure attacks

## Scenario Overview

**Date: March 2028**

Multiple submarine fiber-optic cables connecting Taiwan to the global internet are simultaneously damaged in suspected sabotage. The cables, which carry 99% of Taiwan's international data traffic, suffer breaks at different points on the ocean floor. Taiwan's internet connectivity to the outside world drops by 80%.

Initial reports suggest the damage occurred near cable landing stations but deep underwater, making immediate repair impossible. Repair ships will require 4-6 weeks to fix all breaks. Commercial satellite capacity cannot fully compensate for the lost bandwidth.

Intelligence suggests Chinese fishing vessels and a survey ship were operating near the cable routes shortly before the breaks occurred. However, attribution is uncertain - breaks could be sabotage, accidents, or natural causes (underwater landslides, earthquakes).

Taiwan alleges deliberate Chinese sabotage as part of hybrid warfare strategy. China denies involvement and suggests Taiwan is fabricating claims to garner international sympathy. The crisis creates immediate impacts on Taiwan's economy, financial sector, and ability to coordinate with allies.

## Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Initial Response (Minutes 0-20)

**Inject 1: Economic and Security Impact**

Within 48 hours of cable damage:
- Taiwan stock exchange trading volume drops 60% (unable to handle international transactions)
- TSMC reports disruptions in coordinating with global customers and suppliers
- Taiwan's banks cannot process international wire transfers reliably
- U.S. companies with operations in Taiwan face communications blackouts
- Taiwan military reports degraded coordination capabilities

Taiwan requests:
1. Emergency satellite communications support
2. U.S. intelligence on who damaged cables
3. International condemnation and investigation
4. Protection for repair ships (fears Chinese interference)

**Key Questions:**
1. Without definitive attribution, what is appropriate U.S. response?
2. Should the U.S. provide military escort for cable repair ships if Taiwan requests?
3. What immediate steps can help Taiwan maintain critical communications?

### Phase 2: Attribution and Chinese Pressure (Minutes 20-45)

**Inject 2: Intelligence Assessment**

NSA/CIA provide classified assessment:
- **Likely:** Chinese state-sponsored sabotage (fishing vessels, survey ships operated near cables before breaks)
- **Possible:** Accidental damage from anchor dragging or fishing gear
- **Unlikely:** Natural causes (no seismic activity)
- **Confidence:** Medium (circumstantial evidence, no smoking gun)

Intelligence also reveals:
- China mapping global submarine cable networks using survey ships
- Chinese firms involved in cable manufacturing and repair (potential access/vulnerability)
- Russia previously conducted cable surveillance operations; potential cooperation with China

**Inject 3: Expanding Targeting**

New reports indicate:
- Undersea cable damage detected between Japan and U.S. (Guam) - minor disruption, suspicious timing
- Increased Chinese drone and surface vessel activity near cable routes in South China Sea
- Chinese state media publishes articles on "cable vulnerabilities" and how fragile global connectivity is

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman suggests Taiwan "provoked this crisis with reckless separatist rhetoric" and should bear consequences.

**Key Questions:**
1. At what point does cable sabotage constitute an act of war or trigger mutual defense obligations?
2. How do you deter future attacks when attribution is difficult to prove publicly?
3. Should the U.S. issue public warnings to China despite attribution uncertainty?

### Phase 3: Strategic Response and Escalation Control (Minutes 45-70)

**Inject 4: Escalation Options**

Military proposes:
- Increased naval patrols near critical cable routes
- Classified retaliatory cyber operations against Chinese infrastructure
- Public designation of cable sabotage as "armed attack" triggering Taiwan Relations Act obligations

State Department proposes:
- International investigation through UN or specialized agency
- Coalition statement condemning infrastructure attacks
- New international legal framework for cable protection

Industry proposes:
- Expedited satellite communication deployment
- Redundant cable routes avoiding Chinese-controlled waters
- Screening Chinese firms from cable repair/manufacturing roles

Taiwan urges strong response, warning that cable attacks are "testing" for broader infrastructure campaign or blockade.

**Inject 5: Collateral Damage**

The cable damage has global ripple effects:
- Internet latency increases across Asia-Pacific region
- Some cryptocurrency trading platforms experience disruptions
- Cloud services routing through Taiwan face degraded performance
- Several Southeast Asian countries experience partial outages

Countries with Chinese cable investments (Pakistan, Myanmar, several African nations) experience no disruptions, raising questions about whether they would be targeted or leverage.

**Decision Required:**
1. Public attribution and messaging strategy
2. Military, diplomatic, and economic response measures
3. Protection for cable repair operations and future infrastructure
4. Long-term cable security strategy
5. Deterrence strategy for future infrastructure attacks

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you respond to infrastructure attacks that fall below traditional "armed attack" threshold?
2. Should the U.S. establish "red lines" for critical infrastructure attacks?
3. How do you build resilient communications that cannot be disrupted by cable sabotage?
4. What is appropriate retaliation: cyber operations against Chinese infrastructure, economic sanctions, military posturing?

### Phase 4: Debrief (Minutes 70-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Infrastructure Vulnerability:** Why are submarine cables such attractive targets? What makes defending them difficult?

2. **Attribution Challenge:** How did uncertainty about who caused damage affect response options? What evidence would be sufficient for strong response?

3. **Escalation Control:** How do you respond forcefully without triggering military escalation or cyber warfare spiral?

4. **Gray Zone Conflict:** Infrastructure sabotage sits between peace and war. What frameworks should govern responses?

5. **Resilience vs. Deterrence:** Should strategy emphasize deterring attacks (threats of retaliation) or building resilience (redundancy, diversity)?

6. **International Cooperation:** How can international law and norms better protect critical infrastructure?

7. **Second-Order Effects:**
   - Impact on Taiwan's economic viability and security
   - Precedent for infrastructure attacks in future conflicts
   - Global internet fragmentation and balkanization risks
   - Private sector role in critical infrastructure protection

## Background Materials

**Key Authorities:**
- Taiwan Relations Act, 22 U.S.C. § 3301 et seq.
- Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act
- Communications Act authorities (FCC)
- Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) and cyber operations

**Infrastructure Data:**
- 95%+ of intercontinental data travels via submarine cables
- ~500 submarine cables globally, carrying ~$10 trillion in financial transactions daily
- Taiwan connected by multiple cables (majority land in northern Taiwan)
- Average cable repair time: 2-6 weeks
- Cable routes: Concentration in South China Sea, vulnerable chokepoints

**Precedents:**
