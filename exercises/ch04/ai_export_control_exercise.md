# Tabletop Exercise: AI Export Control Dilemma

**Chapter:** 4 - Technology and Innovation Competition

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Analyze effectiveness and limitations of technology export controls
- Evaluate trade-offs between denying adversary capabilities and harming domestic industry
- Understand challenges of controlling dual-use technologies with global development
- Assess allied coordination in multilateral technology restrictions

## Scenario Overview

**Date: September 2027**

A classified intelligence report reveals that China has made breakthrough progress in developing advanced AI models for military applications, including autonomous weapon systems, intelligence analysis, and cyber warfare tools. The AI models rival OpenAI's GPT-5 and Google's Gemini Ultra in capability.

Investigation reveals that Chinese progress was enabled by:
1. Illegally obtained NVIDIA H100 GPUs smuggled through third countries despite export controls
2. Recruitment of Chinese-American AI researchers who worked at U.S. labs
3. Massive government investment in AI supercomputing infrastructure using slightly older but still capable chips
4. Stolen training data and model architectures from U.S. companies via cyber espionage

The Department of Defense warns that Chinese AI-enabled military systems could narrow or eliminate U.S. technological advantage within 2-3 years if current trends continue. However, U.S. AI companies warn that tighter export controls would:
- Eliminate their largest foreign market (China represents 25% of revenue for some firms)
- Slow AI development by reducing scale and investment returns
- Push China toward complete self-reliance, creating competing global AI standards
- Drive talented researchers away from the U.S. if they cannot collaborate globally

You are convened as the Technology Policy Coordination Committee to recommend export control and AI security policies.

## Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Assessment and Options (Minutes 0-20)

**Inject 1: Intelligence Briefing**

The intelligence community reports:
- China's AI progress is 12-18 months behind cutting-edge U.S. models but closing gap rapidly
- Chinese military is integrating AI into command/control, autonomous systems, cyber operations
- Current export controls are being circumvented via Singapore, Malaysia, UAE transshipment
- Over 500 Chinese-origin researchers work at leading U.S. AI labs; some maintain China ties
- Chinese firms are designing AI chips to work around U.S. export restrictions

Technical assessment shows controlling AI requires addressing:
- **Hardware:** Advanced GPUs/AI chips (current export control focus)
- **Software:** AI frameworks, model architectures, training algorithms
- **Data:** Large datasets needed for training
- **Talent:** AI researchers and engineers
- **Cloud computing:** Access to U.S.-based AI training infrastructure

**Key Questions:**
1. What is the primary objective: delay Chinese AI development, deny specific military applications, or maintain U.S. lead?
2. Which elements (hardware, software, data, talent, cloud) should be controlled, and how?
3. How do you prevent circumvention when AI technology is globally distributed?

### Phase 2: Industry and Allied Reactions (Minutes 20-45)

**Inject 2: Industry Pushback**

Major U.S. AI companies present impact analysis:
- **NVIDIA:** Proposes "middle ground" AI chips for export - powerful but limited for military use; warns full ban costs $10 billion annually
- **OpenAI/Anthropic:** Argue controlling model weights is impractical (easily copied); propose verification systems instead
- **Microsoft/Google:** Warn that losing Chinese market funding will slow global AI development; suggest tiered access based on use cases
- **Meta:** Points out open-source AI models cannot be controlled; advocates focusing on downstream military applications only

Industry threatens:
- Lobbying Congress to block stringent controls
- Moving AI development overseas to avoid U.S. restrictions
- Reducing cooperation with government on AI safety research

**Inject 3: Allied Divergence**

- **Netherlands (ASML):** Will not restrict AI chip lithography equipment sales without WTO-consistent controls
- **Taiwan (TSMC):** Caught between U.S. pressure and economic dependence on Chinese market
- **UK/EU:** Developing separate AI governance frameworks; resistant to export controls that harm competitiveness
- **South Korea (Samsung):** Willing to coordinate but requests compensation for lost Chinese sales
- **Japan:** Supports controls but fears driving China toward complete self-reliance

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you address industry concerns while achieving security objectives?
2. What concessions or incentives bring allies into coordinated export control regime?
3. How do you control open-source AI when models and code are freely published?

### Phase 3: Escalation and Strategic Choices (Minutes 45-70)

**Inject 4: Chinese Response**

China announces:
- **Counter-controls:** Export restrictions on AI training data services and labeled datasets
- **Talent restrictions:** Exit bans on Chinese AI researchers; incentives for overseas Chinese researchers to return
- **Alternative ecosystem:** $100 billion fund for indigenous AI development; mandatory use of Chinese AI models for domestic applications
- **Legal retaliation:** Investigations of U.S. AI companies under Anti-Monopoly Law and Data Security Law

Chinese AI development appears to accelerate in response to controls, with government directing unlimited resources toward self-sufficiency.

**Inject 5: Espionage and Enforcement Challenges**

FBI reports:
- Attempted theft of proprietary AI model weights from U.S. company by insider
- Chinese intelligence recruiting AI researchers at academic conferences
- Covert Chinese access to U.S. cloud computing for AI training via shell companies
- Illegal GPU shipments discovered but likely only small fraction of total smuggling

Commerce Department reports export control violations are difficult to prove and prosecute; companies argue they are complying with "letter of law" while finding creative workarounds.

**Decision Required:** Comprehensive AI technology security strategy including:
1. Export control scope (hardware only, or also software/models/cloud access?)
2. Enforcement mechanisms and resources
3. Allied coordination and burden-sharing
4. Researcher mobility and security policies
5. Domestic AI development acceleration programs
6. Offramps and criteria for adjusting controls

**Key Questions:**
1. Do comprehensive controls that harm U.S. industry make America more or less secure in the long run?
2. How do you prevent controls from accelerating Chinese self-reliance rather than creating dependency?
3. What is enforceable given AI's digital, globally distributed nature?
4. Should controls focus on capabilities (all advanced AI) or specific applications (military AI)?

### Phase 4: Debrief and Analysis (Minutes 70-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Effectiveness Assessment:** Can export controls significantly delay Chinese AI development, or do they merely reduce U.S. industry revenue while China achieves self-reliance anyway?

2. **Dual-Use Challenge:** AI is inherently dual-use (civilian and military applications inseparable). How do you control military applications without restricting beneficial civilian innovation?

3. **Industry Incentives:** How did you align profit-seeking private companies with national security objectives? Were carrots (subsidies, market protection) or sticks (mandatory controls) more effective?

4. **Talent and Openness:** The U.S. AI lead depends on attracting global talent and open research collaboration. How do you balance openness with security?

5. **Allied Coordination:** Why is AI export control coordination harder than Cold War-era CoCom? How sustainable is multilateral cooperation when allies have competing interests?

6. **Strategic Logic:**
   - If controls work: Does delaying Chinese AI create window for U.S. to build insurmountable lead?
   - If controls fail: Do they still impose costs on China (slower, more expensive development)?
   - Unintended consequences: Accelerating Chinese AI industry, fragmenting global AI ecosystem

7. **Long-term Vision:** What is the end state - permanent technological bifurcation, temporary delay until negotiated AI arms control, or failed attempt at containment?

8. **Alternative Approaches:** Rather than export controls, should strategy emphasize:
   - Outcompeting through superior investment and innovation
   - International AI safety governance reducing proliferation risks
   - Defensive measures (counterintelligence, securing U.S. models) rather than denying China access
