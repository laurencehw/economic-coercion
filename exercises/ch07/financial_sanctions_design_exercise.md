# Tabletop Exercise: Designing a Comprehensive Financial Sanctions Regime

**Chapter:** 7 - Financial Statecraft and Sanctions

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Design effective financial sanctions packages balancing leverage and costs
- Evaluate trade-offs between comprehensive sanctions and targeted measures
- Understand challenges of sanctions enforcement and evasion
- Assess de-dollarization risks from aggressive sanctions use

## Scenario Overview

**Date: April 2028**

The military junta in Myanmar, which has ruled since the 2021 coup, intensifies its brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, ethnic minorities, and civil society. Reports document:
- Mass killings of civilians by security forces
- Widespread use of torture and arbitrary detention
- Forced displacement of 500,000+ Rohingya and ethnic minorities
- Blocking humanitarian aid access to conflict zones
- Attacks on schools, hospitals, and religious sites

International outrage grows following leaked videos of atrocities. Congress passes bipartisan legislation demanding the Administration impose "comprehensive sanctions" on Myanmar's military regime. Regional allies (India, Thailand, Japan) express concern about refugee flows and regional instability but are reluctant to isolate Myanmar, which could drive it deeper into Chinese orbit.

You are convened as the Sanctions Policy Coordination Committee to design a financial sanctions package that maximizes pressure on the junta while managing humanitarian, economic, and geopolitical complications.

## Participant Roles

**Deputy Secretary of Treasury**
- Responsibilities: OFAC sanctions, financial system stability
- Interests: Effective pressure on junta, protecting dollar system integrity
- Constraints: De-dollarization concerns, enforcement challenges

**Deputy Secretary of State**
- Responsibilities: Diplomatic pressure, humanitarian concerns, regional stability
- Interests: Supporting democracy, protecting civilians, allied coordination
- Constraints: Regional allies resistant to sanctions, Chinese influence

**Deputy National Security Advisor**
- Responsibilities: Balancing competing interests, strategic objectives
- Interests: Preventing Chinese domination of Myanmar, promoting democratic norms
- Constraints: Limited leverage over military junta, regional complexity

**USAID Administrator**
- Responsibilities: Humanitarian assistance, development programs
- Interests: Maintaining access to vulnerable populations
- Constraints: Sanctions can block humanitarian aid flows

**NSC Director for Asia**
- Responsibilities: Regional strategy, managing China factor
- Interests: Preventing Myanmar becoming Chinese client state
- Constraints: Sanctions may push junta toward Beijing

**NGO Human Rights Advocate**
- Responsibilities: Represent civil society and democracy activists
- Interests: Maximum pressure on junta, accountability for atrocities
- Constraints: No formal authority, limited information

## Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Sanctions Design (Minutes 0-20)

**Inject 1: Sanctions Menu**

Treasury presents options:
1. **Comprehensive/Country-Level:** Block all financial transactions with Myanmar (similar to North Korea/Iran)
2. **Sectoral:** Target specific industries (natural gas, jade, gemstones generating junta revenue)
3. **Targeted/Individual:** Sanction specific junta leaders, military units, businesses
4. **Financial Institution:** Block Myanmar banks from dollar system, SWIFT access
5. **Secondary:** Sanction third parties doing business with Myanmar junta

For each option, assessment provided:
- Estimated impact on junta revenue and behavior
- Humanitarian costs (blocking food, medicine, banking for civilians)
- Enforcement challenges (evasion through China, Thailand)
- Allied coordination needs
- De-dollarization risks (driving countries toward alternative payment systems)

**Key Questions:**
1. What is the primary objective: compel junta to negotiate power transfer, punish atrocities, or degrade military capabilities?
2. How do you maximize pressure on junta while minimizing humanitarian harm to civilian population?
3. Which sanctions approach (comprehensive, sectoral, targeted) best balances effectiveness and costs?

### Phase 2: Enforcement and Evasion (Minutes 20-45)

**Inject 2: Evasion Routes**

Intelligence reveals:
- **China:** Providing financial lifeline through yuan-denominated trade, alternative payment systems (CIPS)
- **Thailand:** Thai banks facilitating transactions despite U.S. pressure; cross-border informal finance
- **Singapore:** Shell companies obscuring beneficial ownership of Myanmar businesses
- **Cryptocurrency:** Junta leaders using crypto to move funds and evade detection
- **Hawala networks:** Informal value transfer systems bypassing formal banking

Enforcement challenges:
- Limited Treasury/DoJ resources to investigate complex evasion schemes
- Difficulty distinguishing legitimate humanitarian transactions from sanctions violations
- Third-country resistance to enforcing U.S. sanctions

**Inject 3: Humanitarian Impact**

USAID and NGOs report sanctions side effects:
- Banks refusing all Myanmar transactions due to over-compliance (de-risking)
- Humanitarian organizations cannot pay staff or purchase supplies
- Remittances from migrant workers (critical for families) blocked
- Medical supply imports disrupted
- Food prices spiking due to import financing difficulties

Democracy activists inside Myanmar send message: "We support sanctions on junta, but please don't starve the population."

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you design humanitarian exemptions that allow aid while preventing junta exploitation?
2. Should U.S. use secondary sanctions to compel third-party compliance, even if it damages relationships?
3. What enforcement resources and mechanisms are needed to make sanctions effective?

### Phase 3: Strategic Trade-offs and Geopolitical Complications (Minutes 45-70)

**Inject 4: Chinese Counter-Moves**

China responds to U.S. sanctions by:
- Increasing economic engagement with Myanmar ($10 billion investment package)
- Offering Myanmar access to Chinese alternative payment systems
- Proposing "Myanmar peace process" that would legitimize junta while marginalizing democracy opposition
- Using Myanmar as example in international fora of "U.S. unilateral coercion" and why countries need alternatives to dollar system

**Inject 5: Regional Allies Pushback**

- **India:** Concerned about Chinese influence; quietly engaging with junta; opposes sanctions that empower Beijing
- **Thailand:** Hosts 100,000 Myanmar refugees; fears sanctions will increase flows; resists enforcement cooperation
- **Japan:** Supports democracy rhetorically but has business interests in Myanmar; prefers engagement to sanctions
- **ASEAN:** Divided; some members support sanctions, others prioritize non-interference principle

Allies request U.S. provide:
- Funding for refugee support if sanctions increase displacement
- Alternative economic engagement plans if they comply with sanctions
- Coordination on "carrots" for junta (sanctions relief conditions)

**Decision Required:** Final sanctions package including:
1. Scope (comprehensive, sectoral, or targeted)
2. Humanitarian exemption mechanisms
3. Secondary sanctions on third parties
4. Enforcement strategy and resources
5. Allied coordination and burden-sharing
6. Conditionality (clear criteria for sanctions relief)
7. Accompanying diplomatic and economic measures

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you prevent sanctions from driving Myanmar further into Chinese sphere?
2. Are sanctions sustainable if regional allies don't cooperate and China provides alternatives?
3. What combination of pressure (sanctions) and incentives (sanctions relief, aid) creates path to resolution?
4. How do you manage risk that aggressive sanctions use accelerates global de-dollarization?

### Phase 4: Debrief (Minutes 70-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Effectiveness:** Can financial sanctions compel behavior change by determined autocratic regime?
2. **Humanitarian Balance:** How did you navigate tension between pressure and humanitarian protection?
3. **Enforcement:** What makes sanctions enforceable versus easily evaded?
4. **Allied Coordination:** Why is multilateral cooperation difficult even when allies share values?
5. **Unintended Consequences:** De-dollarization, Chinese influence, civilian suffering, NGO de-banking
6. **Long-term Strategy:** Exit strategy? Conditions for lifting sanctions? How to avoid permanent isolation?
