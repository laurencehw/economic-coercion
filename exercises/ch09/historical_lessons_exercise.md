# Tabletop Exercise: Applying Historical Lessons to Contemporary Challenges

**Chapter:** 9 - Historical and Comparative Cases

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Extract generalizable lessons from historical sanctions cases
- Compare effectiveness factors across different eras and contexts
- Apply historical frameworks to contemporary policy challenges
- Understand limitations of historical analogies

## Scenario Overview

**Date: May 2028**

Following a military coup in a strategically located country (fictional "Meridiana"), the National Security Council must design a coercive economic strategy. You are tasked with applying lessons from three historical cases to inform your recommendations:

1. **CoCom (1949-1994):** Multilateral technology denial against Soviet bloc
2. **South African Apartheid Sanctions (1960s-1994):** Comprehensive sanctions contributing to regime change
3. **Cuba Embargo (1960-present):** Long-running unilateral sanctions with limited effectiveness

**Current Crisis:** Meridiana's military has overthrown democratically elected government, arrested opposition leaders, and declared martial law. The country sits at a critical geographic chokepoint for energy transit and hosts significant rare earth deposits. Both China and Russia have economic interests in Meridiana and are offering financial support to the junta.

## Participant Roles

**Deputy Secretary of State (Historical Case 1: CoCom Expert)**
- Assigned to present CoCom lessons: multilateral coordination, technology denial effectiveness, allied burden-sharing

**Deputy Secretary of Treasury (Historical Case 2: South Africa Expert)**
- Assigned to present South Africa lessons: comprehensive sanctions, corporate divestment, role of domestic opposition

**Deputy National Security Advisor (Historical Case 3: Cuba Expert)**
- Assigned to present Cuba lessons: unilateral sanctions limitations, regime resilience, humanitarian costs

**Policy Planning Staff Director**
- Synthesize lessons across cases and identify relevant applications

**Intelligence Officer**
- Provide current intelligence on Meridiana situation

**Academic Historian (External Advisor)**
- Challenge assumptions and highlight where historical analogies may mislead

## Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Historical Case Presentations (Minutes 0-30)

**Inject 1: CoCom Case (10 minutes)**

Presenter covers:
- **Structure:** NATO allies plus Japan coordinated export controls on strategic technologies to Soviet bloc
- **Effectiveness:** Successfully degraded Soviet military-industrial capabilities; forced costly indigenous development
- **Keys to success:** (1) Allied unity based on shared Soviet threat, (2) Clear technology lists, (3) Long time horizon (40+ years), (4) Soviet relative economic isolation
- **Limitations:** Required constant diplomatic maintenance; allies cheated; Soviet eventually developed alternatives

**Lessons for Meridiana:**
- Multilateral cooperation multiplies effectiveness but is hard to achieve/sustain
- Technology denial works if target cannot easily substitute
- Requires long-term commitment measured in decades, not years

**Inject 2: South Africa Apartheid Sanctions (10 minutes)**

Presenter covers:
- **Evolution:** Gradual escalation from arms embargo (1960s/70s) to comprehensive sanctions (1980s)
- **Mechanisms:** UN sanctions, corporate divestment, capital flight, cultural/sports boycotts, oil embargo
- **Effectiveness:** Contributed to regime change (1994) but not sole factor; domestic resistance critical
- **Keys to success:** (1) Global moral consensus against apartheid, (2) South African business community support for change, (3) Internal resistance (ANC, labor), (4) Security deterioration
- **Limitations:** Sanctions alone insufficient; required combination with internal pressure

**Lessons for Meridiana:**
- Comprehensive sanctions can work but require moral legitimacy and internal opposition partners
- Corporate and financial sector pressure can be powerful
- Humanitarian costs of comprehensive sanctions are significant
- Multilateral legitimacy (UN) matters

**Inject 3: Cuba Embargo (10 minutes)**

Presenter covers:
- **Structure:** U.S. unilateral comprehensive embargo (1960-present)
- **Objectives:** Initially regime change; later deterrence of Latin American communism; eventually normalized as policy inertia
- **Effectiveness:** Failed to achieve regime change despite 60+ years; regime adapted and survived
- **Why it failed:** (1) Unilateral (other countries traded with Cuba), (2) Soviet support until 1991, (3) Regime maintained domestic control, (4) Nationalism ("resistance to imperialism") legitimized regime
- **Costs:** Humanitarian suffering; U.S. isolation in hemisphere; entrenched Castro regime

**Lessons for Meridiana:**
- Unilateral sanctions against regime with external support rarely succeed
- Long-term sanctions can entrench target regime and rally nationalist support
- Clear exit criteria essential to avoid policy inertia
- Humanitarian exemptions critical

### Phase 2: Analyzing Meridiana (Minutes 30-55)

**Inject 4: Current Intelligence Assessment**

**Meridiana Profile:**
- Population: 30 million
- Economy: Middle-income, dependent on energy transit fees and rare earth exports
- Government: Military junta following coup; popular protests suppressed
- External support: China offering $5 billion loan; Russia providing military equipment
- Opposition: Fragmented; democratic forces arrested; limited organized resistance
- Humanitarian: Food/medicine imports needed; drought threatening famine
- Allies: Regional neighbors divided; some support junta (fear instability), others support democracy

**U.S. Interests:**
- Energy security (30% of Asian LNG transits through Meridiana straits)
- Rare earth access (Meridiana has 20% of global deposits)
- Democratic norms and credibility
- Preventing Chinese/Russian sphere of influence expansion

**Constraints:**
- Limited U.S. trade with Meridiana ($2 billion annually)
- European allies dependent on energy transit
- China and Russia willing to provide economic lifeline
- Regional allies fear refugee flows if sanctions cause collapse

**Key Questions:**
1. Which historical case is most analogous to Meridiana? Why?
2. What contextual differences make historical lessons less applicable?
3. Which success factors from historical cases are present/absent in Meridiana?

### Phase 3: Strategy Design (Minutes 55-80)

**Inject 5: Policy Options**

Participants must design sanctions strategy addressing:

**Objectives Clarity:**
- What is achievable goal: regime change, policy change, containment, or signaling?
- What would constitute success allowing sanctions to be lifted?

**Sanctions Scope:**
- Comprehensive (all trade/finance) or targeted (specific sectors/individuals)?
- Unilateral U.S. or multilateral coalition?
- Which sectors to target: energy transit, rare earths, banking, military?

**Allied Coordination:**
- How to secure European participation despite energy dependencies?
- What incentives/burden-sharing needed?
- UN sanctions (unlikely given Chinese/Russian veto) or coalition of willing?

**Timeline and Sustainability:**
- Short-term pressure (months) or long-term strategy (years/decades)?
- How to sustain domestic and allied support over time?

**Combination with Other Tools:**
- Support for internal opposition (lessons from South Africa)?
- Diplomatic isolation and legitimacy-building?
- Humanitarian exemptions and monitoring?

**Exit Strategy:**
- What junta actions trigger sanctions relief?
- How to avoid Cuba scenario of perpetual sanctions?

**Key Questions:**
1. Based on historical lessons, which approach has best chance of success?
2. How do you adapt historical lessons to different contemporary context?
3. What are realistic objectives given Meridiana's external support and U.S. limited leverage?

### Phase 4: Debrief and Meta-Analysis (Minutes 80-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Analogy Limits:** When are historical analogies helpful versus misleading? What makes Meridiana different from CoCom-era Soviet Union, apartheid South Africa, or Castro's Cuba?

2. **Success Factors:** Across historical cases, what factors correlate with sanctions effectiveness:
   - Multilateral coordination?
   - Target isolation vs. external support?
   - Internal opposition strength?
   - Moral legitimacy?
   - Time horizon?
   - Economic integration level?

3. **Failure Patterns:** Why do sanctions fail:
   - Circumvention by third parties?
   - Target regime resilience?
   - Humanitarian costs undermining support?
   - Policy inertia replacing strategic logic?

4. **Contemporary Differences:** How does 21st century globalization, digital connectivity, and Chinese alternative financing change sanctions effectiveness compared to Cold War era?

5. **Learning Correctly:** What biases affect historical lesson-drawing:
   - Selection bias (studying successful cases, ignoring failures)?
   - Overgeneralization (assuming one context applies to all)?
   - Recency bias (overweighting recent cases)?

6. **Policy Implications:** Should U.S. rely less on economic coercion given historical mixed record? Or can design improvements increase effectiveness?
