## Risk Management

### Potential Challenges
1. **Scope creep** - Mitigation: Stick to chapter outlines
2. **Data access issues** - Mitigation: Identify alternative sources early
3. **Time slippage** - Mitigation: Weekly progress reviews
4. **Maintaining Chinese perspective quality** - Mitigation: Consult Chinese-language sources, seek expert review

### Contingency Plans
- If behind schedule: Prioritize core chapters (1-8), simplify Chapter 9-10
- If data unavailable: Document limitation, use proxy measures
- If expert review delayed: Proceed with self-review, incorporate feedback in next edition
