# Chapter 1: Foundations of Economic Statecraft in the 21st Century

## Executive Summary

On October 7, 2022, the United States imposed sweeping export controls targeting China's semiconductor industry. The measures restricted not only American technology and equipment, but also deployed a novel "foreign direct product rule" to prevent any advanced chips made anywhere in the world with US tools from reaching Chinese firms. The action represented economic statecraft on an unprecedented scale—an attempt to use commercial restrictions to constrain a strategic rival's technological development. China's response was equally telling: rather than military escalation, Beijing accelerated its "dual circulation" strategy, launched investigations into American firms under its Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, and tightened export controls on critical minerals like gallium and germanium. This was not traditional economic warfare. It was something new: the systematic weaponization of economic interdependence.

Welcome to the era of geoeconomics. After decades in which economic globalization and security competition seemed to occupy separate spheres, the boundaries have collapsed. Trade relationships, supply chains, technology standards, and financial flows are now instruments of statecraft. Economic coercion—the use of economic measures to compel behavioral changes in other states—has become central to how great powers compete. For policymakers, business leaders, and citizens navigating this landscape, understanding these dynamics is no longer optional.

This book provides a comprehensive guide to economic coercion in the context of US-China strategic competition. It examines how states use economic tools to pursue security objectives, why such measures succeed or fail, and what the proliferation of economic statecraft means for the international system. The focus is practical: each chapter explains specific tools available to governments, analyzes real-world cases, and explores decision-making through tabletop exercises. But the book also takes seriously the need for strategic empathy—understanding how different actors perceive threats, opportunities, and constraints.

Three core arguments organize our analysis. First, contemporary economic coercion reflects the structural condition of weaponized interdependence. Global networks for finance, technology, and trade create chokepoints—nodes of asymmetric dependency that can be exploited for coercive leverage. The United States benefits from centrality in dollar-denominated finance, internet infrastructure, and semiconductor supply chains. China increasingly holds comparable positions in critical minerals, electric vehicle batteries, and manufacturing capacity. Understanding where these chokepoints exist and how they can be leveraged is fundamental to modern statecraft.

Second, effectiveness in economic coercion depends on more than material capability. Success requires understanding target decision-making, managing allied coordination, anticipating retaliation, and sustaining domestic support. The most sophisticated sanctions can fail if targets can adapt, allies defect, or domestic constituencies lose patience. Conversely, seemingly modest restrictions can succeed when they target genuine vulnerabilities and are paired with viable off-ramps. This book develops a framework for analyzing economic coercion across four dimensions: the domain of action (trade, finance, technology, investment), the target (state, firm, individual), the objective (deterrence, compellence, containment, signaling), and the intensity (from diplomatic pressure to comprehensive economic warfare).

Third, and perhaps most importantly, effective strategy requires understanding adversary perspectives. Chinese policymakers do not view American export controls as defensive measures to protect national security. They see them as containment, echoing historical efforts to keep China weak and dependent. This perception—rooted in the "Century of Humiliation" and reinforced by contemporary experience—shapes Beijing's responses. Similarly, American concerns about Chinese economic coercion reflect genuine anxieties about dependency on a strategic competitor. Neither perspective is simply "propaganda." Both reflect real historical experiences and contemporary threat perceptions. Effective policy must account for these divergent worldviews.

This chapter establishes foundations. It defines key concepts—geoeconomics, economic statecraft, weaponized interdependence, and economic coercion—and explains how they relate. It traces the arc of US-China economic relations from engagement through growing competition. It introduces analytical frameworks used throughout the book. And critically, it presents both American and Chinese perspectives on economic statecraft, explaining how different historical experiences produce different strategic logics. The chapter includes two detailed case studies—the Cold War-era Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) and the 2022 exclusion of Russian banks from SWIFT—that illustrate how economic coercion works in practice.

The stakes are high. How the United States and China manage their economic interdependence while competing strategically may determine whether this century sees stable competition or catastrophic conflict. Understanding the tools, limitations, and logic of economic coercion is essential for navigating that challenge.
