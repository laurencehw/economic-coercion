# Chapter 1: Foundations of Economic Statecraft in the 21st Century

## Executive Summary

On October 7, 2022, the United States imposed sweeping export controls targeting China's semiconductor industry. The measures restricted not only American technology and equipment, but also deployed a novel "foreign direct product rule" to prevent any advanced chips made anywhere in the world with US tools from reaching Chinese firms. The action represented economic statecraft on an unprecedented scale—an attempt to use commercial restrictions to constrain a strategic rival's technological development. China's response was equally telling: rather than military escalation, Beijing accelerated its "dual circulation" strategy, launched investigations into American firms under its Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, and tightened export controls on critical minerals like gallium and germanium. This was not traditional economic warfare. It was something new: the systematic weaponization of economic interdependence.

Welcome to the era of geoeconomics. After decades in which economic globalization and security competition seemed to occupy separate spheres, the boundaries have collapsed. Trade relationships, supply chains, technology standards, and financial flows are now instruments of statecraft. Economic coercion—the use of economic measures to compel behavioral changes in other states—has become central to how great powers compete. For policymakers, business leaders, and citizens navigating this landscape, understanding these dynamics is no longer optional.

This book provides a comprehensive guide to economic coercion in the context of US-China strategic competition. It examines how states use economic tools to pursue security objectives, why such measures succeed or fail, and what the proliferation of economic statecraft means for the international system. The focus is practical: each chapter explains specific tools available to governments, analyzes real-world cases, and explores decision-making through tabletop exercises. But the book also takes seriously the need for strategic empathy—understanding how different actors perceive threats, opportunities, and constraints.

Three core arguments organize our analysis. First, contemporary economic coercion reflects the structural condition of weaponized interdependence. Global networks for finance, technology, and trade create chokepoints—nodes of asymmetric dependency that can be exploited for coercive leverage. The United States benefits from centrality in dollar-denominated finance, internet infrastructure, and semiconductor supply chains. China increasingly holds comparable positions in critical minerals, electric vehicle batteries, and manufacturing capacity. Understanding where these chokepoints exist and how they can be leveraged is fundamental to modern statecraft.

Second, effectiveness in economic coercion depends on more than material capability. Success requires understanding target decision-making, managing allied coordination, anticipating retaliation, and sustaining domestic support. The most sophisticated sanctions can fail if targets can adapt, allies defect, or domestic constituencies lose patience. Conversely, seemingly modest restrictions can succeed when they target genuine vulnerabilities and are paired with viable off-ramps. This book develops a framework for analyzing economic coercion across four dimensions: the domain of action (trade, finance, technology, investment), the target (state, firm, individual), the objective (deterrence, compellence, containment, signaling), and the intensity (from diplomatic pressure to comprehensive economic warfare).

Third, and perhaps most importantly, effective strategy requires understanding adversary perspectives. Chinese policymakers do not view American export controls as defensive measures to protect national security. They see them as containment, echoing historical efforts to keep China weak and dependent. This perception—rooted in the "Century of Humiliation" and reinforced by contemporary experience—shapes Beijing's responses. Similarly, American concerns about Chinese economic coercion reflect genuine anxieties about dependency on a strategic competitor. Neither perspective is simply "propaganda." Both reflect real historical experiences and contemporary threat perceptions. Effective policy must account for these divergent worldviews.

This chapter establishes foundations. It defines key concepts—geoeconomics, economic statecraft, weaponized interdependence, and economic coercion—and explains how they relate. It traces the arc of US-China economic relations from engagement through growing competition. It introduces analytical frameworks used throughout the book. And critically, it presents both American and Chinese perspectives on economic statecraft, explaining how different historical experiences produce different strategic logics. The chapter includes two detailed case studies—the Cold War-era Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) and the 2022 exclusion of Russian banks from SWIFT—that illustrate how economic coercion works in practice.

The stakes are high. How the United States and China manage their economic interdependence while competing strategically may determine whether this century sees stable competition or catastrophic conflict. Understanding the tools, limitations, and logic of economic coercion is essential for navigating that challenge.

## Section 1: Introduction - The Return of Economic Statecraft

### 1.1 Opening Vignette: The October 2022 Semiconductor Controls

The meeting was classified, the implications global. In early October 2022, senior officials from the Departments of Commerce, State, Defense, and the National Security Council gathered to finalize the most aggressive peacetime export controls the United States had ever imposed. Their target: China's advanced semiconductor industry and, by extension, its ambitions in artificial intelligence, supercomputing, and military modernization.

The resulting measures, announced on October 7, 2022, were breathtaking in scope. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) added 31 Chinese entities to the Entity List, blocking them from receiving American technology. Far more significantly, BIS imposed sweeping new restrictions on exporting semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China and updated the "foreign direct product rule" (FDPR) to prevent chips made anywhere in the world with American equipment from reaching designated Chinese firms. The controls effectively weaponized America's chokepoint position in the global semiconductor supply chain: no country can produce cutting-edge chips at scale without US equipment, software, and intellectual property.

The measures also contained a remarkable provision targeting people, not just products. Under the new "U.S. person" rule, American citizens and green card holders were prohibited from supporting development or production of advanced chips at Chinese facilities—even those not otherwise subject to U.S. jurisdiction. This represented economic statecraft directed not just at rival governments or companies, but at individual engineers and their career choices.

China's response revealed how deeply these measures struck. State media denounced them as "technological hegemony" and "economic bullying." The Ministry of Commerce announced it would "resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies." More concretely, Beijing accelerated implementation of its "dual circulation" strategy, emphasizing domestic semiconductor development despite massive technical challenges. It launched antitrust and data security investigations into American firms like Micron. And in July 2023, China imposed export controls on gallium and germanium—obscure metals critical for semiconductors and defense applications—demonstrating its own chokepoint leverage.

This episode crystallizes the central dynamic of contemporary great power competition. The United States and China are locked in a struggle over the commanding heights of 21st-century technology, and economic tools have become the primary instruments of that struggle. Neither side launched missiles or moved troops. Instead, they manipulated supply chain dependencies, restricted access to critical inputs, and used regulatory authority to reshape patterns of global commerce. This is economic statecraft in the modern era.

### 1.2 The Paradox of Interdependence

For decades, economic interdependence was assumed to be a pacifying force. The logic was straightforward: countries that trade extensively have shared interests in stability, mutual prosperity, and maintaining open markets. War becomes irrational when it disrupts profitable exchange. This "capitalist peace" thesis underpinned much of post-Cold War Western strategy, particularly toward China. Integrating China into global institutions and supply chains would not only enrich all parties but also make conflict prohibitively costly.

The paradox is that interdependence creates both constraints and opportunities. Yes, economic integration raises the costs of conflict. But it also creates asymmetric dependencies—structural vulnerabilities that can be exploited for coercive leverage. When one country controls chokepoints in critical networks, it can weaponize those positions to extract concessions, punish adversaries, or constrain rivals' strategic options. Rather than preventing coercion, interdependence can enable it.

Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman's concept of "weaponized interdependence" captures this dynamic. Global networks—for finance, trade, technology, information—are not evenly distributed. They have hubs: nodes of concentration where transactions must pass through specific institutions, platforms, or jurisdictions. The United States sits at the center of dollar-denominated finance (SWIFT system, correspondent banking), internet infrastructure (submarine cables, cloud services, DNS root servers), and advanced technology supply chains (semiconductors, software, aerospace). China increasingly occupies comparable positions in rare earth processing, electric vehicle batteries, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and certain manufacturing supply chains.

These hub positions create what Farrell and Newman call "panopticon" and "chokepoint" effects. The panopticon effect allows the hub state to see network flows—monitoring transactions, communications, and exchanges. The chokepoint effect allows it to deny access—blocking specific actors from the network or withholding critical inputs. Both capabilities can be weaponized: surveillance enables intelligence gathering and sanctions enforcement, while denial enables coercion.

The result is a fundamental tension. Economic integration does constrain: sanctioning China's semiconductor industry imposes costs on American firms (lost sales, reduced economies of scale) and allies (disrupted supply chains, technology restrictions). But integration also empowers: without reliance on U.S. semiconductor equipment, American controls would have no bite. The same interdependence that creates peace constituencies also creates coercive leverage.

This paradox generates strategic dilemmas. How much economic integration is optimal when potential adversaries are involved? Should states prioritize economic efficiency or strategic autonomy? Can chokepoint dependencies be maintained without provoking retaliation or accelerating rivals' efforts at self-sufficiency? These questions have no easy answers, but understanding the dual nature of interdependence is essential for navigating them.

### 1.3 Why Now? Four Structural Drivers

Economic coercion is not new. Imperial Britain used trade restrictions and naval blockades. The United States orchestrated Cold War export controls through CoCom. Economic sanctions have long been a staple of foreign policy. Yet the current era is distinctive in the intensity, sophistication, and centrality of economic statecraft. Four structural factors explain why.

**First: The rise of China as a peer economic competitor.** For the first time since 1945, the United States faces a rival with comparable economic scale and technological ambition. China is the world's largest trading nation, its second-largest economy, and increasingly a technological frontier state in domains from 5G to artificial intelligence to electric vehicles. This creates both motivation and capability for economic competition. The U.S. cannot ignore China's economic power, and China cannot accept permanent technological subordination. Economic coercion becomes a primary mechanism for managing this rivalry short of military conflict.

**Second: The digitalization and networkization of economic activity.** Modern economies run on digital networks: financial transactions through SWIFT and correspondent banking, internet traffic through submarine cables and cloud platforms, manufacturing through complex supply chains coordinated by enterprise software. This digitalization amplifies chokepoint effects. Cutting a country off from SWIFT is far more effective than historical financial sanctions because modern finance is fundamentally networked. Similarly, denying access to advanced chips or cloud services can cripple development in AI, quantum computing, and other strategic technologies in ways that Cold War-era export controls on machine tools could not.

**Third: The fragmentation of the liberal international order.** During the unipolar moment of the 1990s and early 2000s, the United States could largely shape global rules in ways that served its interests. Institutions like the WTO, IMF, and World Bank embedded American preferences. Today, that consensus has fractured. China offers alternative institutions (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Belt and Road Initiative) and contests existing rules. The result is a more contested economic order where states increasingly use economic tools to reshape rules and institutions in their favor, rather than accepting a single set of neutral market principles.

**Fourth: The blurring of economic and security domains.** Emerging technologies increasingly have dual-use applications: artificial intelligence enhances both facial recognition apps and autonomous weapons systems; quantum computing promises breakthroughs in drug discovery and code-breaking; biotechnology enables personalized medicine and biological weapons. This dual-use character means that commercial competition in cutting-edge technologies is inseparable from security competition. States cannot afford to treat trade, investment, and technology development as purely economic matters when those same capabilities determine military effectiveness and intelligence dominance.

Together, these four factors—peer economic competition with China, networked digital economies, fragmentation of the liberal order, and dual-use technology convergence—create an environment where economic coercion is both more feasible and more necessary as a tool of statecraft. Understanding this structural context is essential for making sense of specific policy choices, from semiconductor export controls to rare earth restrictions to financial sanctions.

The remainder of this chapter builds on this foundation. We first define key concepts precisely (geoeconomics, economic statecraft, weaponized interdependence, economic coercion). We then examine the arc of US-China economic relations and the specific strategic perspectives each side brings. Finally, we develop analytical frameworks for understanding when and how economic coercion works—frameworks that will be applied throughout the book's subsequent chapters.

## Section 2: Defining Key Concepts

Precision matters. The terms "geoeconomics," "economic statecraft," "weaponized interdependence," and "economic coercion" are often used interchangeably in policy debates, but they describe distinct—though related—phenomena. Clear definitions enable clearer thinking about when, why, and how states use economic power for strategic purposes.

### 2.1 Geoeconomics

**Geoeconomics** refers to the use of economic instruments to produce geopolitical outcomes. The term was coined by Edward Luttwak in the early 1990s to describe how states compete for power and influence through economic means in an era when military competition among major powers had become prohibitively risky. Where geopolitics is about the relationship between geography, power, and strategy, geoeconomics applies that logic to economic domains: trade, investment, finance, technology, and resources.

Geoeconomic competition manifests in several ways. States may use trade policy to build spheres of influence—consider China's Belt and Road Initiative, which uses infrastructure investment and trade relationships to expand Beijing's political influence across Eurasia, Africa, and Latin America. They may weaponize access to their markets—the European Union uses the threat of excluding firms from its large consumer market to impose regulatory standards globally, what Anu Bradford calls the "Brussels Effect." They may compete for dominance in strategic industries—U.S.-China rivalry over 5G telecommunications reflects both sides' recognition that whoever sets standards for next-generation communications infrastructure gains strategic advantage. Or they may seek control over critical resources—competition for rare earth minerals, semiconductor supply chains, and energy transit routes all reflect geoeconomic logics.

The geoeconomic lens reveals three key dynamics. First, economic power is relative, not just absolute. What matters is not just a country's GDP, but its ability to shape global economic rules, control chokepoints in networks, and withstand pressure. China's GDP may be substantial, but its dependence on imported semiconductors creates vulnerability despite its overall economic size. Second, economic interdependence creates strategic opportunities and vulnerabilities. States simultaneously seek to maximize others' dependence on them while minimizing their own dependence on potential adversaries. Third, economic and security domains are deeply intertwined. Commercial competition in emerging technologies directly affects military balances, intelligence capabilities, and economic resilience.

Geoeconomics is not inherently adversarial. States can use economic tools to build partnerships, reward friends, and create positive-sum outcomes. The Marshall Plan exemplified geoeconomic strategy aimed at reconstruction and alliance-building, not coercion. Contemporary development finance and trade agreements often serve similar purposes. But in an era of great power competition, the competitive and coercive dimensions of geoeconomics have become increasingly prominent.

The shift toward geoeconomic competition reflects structural changes in the international system. During the Cold War, the economic and security spheres were substantially decoupled: the West traded internally, the Communist bloc did likewise, and military competition dominated superpower relations. Today, the United States and China are deeply economically integrated while simultaneously engaged in strategic competition. This creates demand for geoeconomic tools—economic measures that can advance security objectives without triggering military escalation.

### 2.2 Economic Statecraft

**Economic statecraft** is the subset of geoeconomics focused on deliberate government policies using economic tools to achieve foreign policy objectives. Where geoeconomics describes a broad strategic domain, economic statecraft refers to specific policy instruments and their application.

David Baldwin's classic definition frames economic statecraft as "influence attempts relying primarily on resources which have a reasonable semblance of a market price in terms of money." This encompasses both positive inducements (foreign aid, preferential trade agreements, investment, debt relief) and negative sanctions (trade restrictions, asset freezes, financial exclusion, technology denial). The key is intentionality: economic statecraft involves purposeful government action to achieve specific foreign policy goals through economic means.

Economic statecraft operates across multiple domains. In the **trade domain**, tools include tariffs, quotas, export controls, import bans, and preferential trade agreements. The United States uses export controls to prevent advanced technology from reaching rivals; China uses informal trade restrictions to punish countries for political decisions it opposes (see the 2010 rare earth export restrictions after Japan detained a Chinese fishing captain, or the 2020-2021 trade restrictions on Australia following Canberra's calls for a COVID-19 investigation). In the **financial domain**, statecraft includes sanctions, asset freezes, exclusion from payment systems (SWIFT), secondary sanctions on third parties doing business with targets, and restrictions on dollar access. U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) maintains multiple sanctions programs targeting countries (Iran, North Korea, Russia), entities, and individuals. In the **investment domain**, tools include foreign direct investment screening, forced divestment, restrictions on portfolio investment, and development finance. CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) reviews foreign acquisitions of American firms for national security implications. In the **technology domain**, statecraft encompasses export controls, investment restrictions, talent restrictions, standard-setting, and technology transfer requirements. The October 2022 semiconductor controls exemplify technology statecraft.

Effectiveness varies dramatically across contexts. Economic statecraft succeeds when it changes target behavior in desired ways at acceptable cost. Success depends on several factors: the target's vulnerability (is the sanctioned good/service critical and difficult to substitute?), the sanctioner's credibility (will threatened measures actually be imposed?), allied coordination (can the target find alternative suppliers?), and target decision-making (does the target regime value the benefits of compliance more than the political costs?). Many sanctions fail because targets can adapt, allies defect, or political constraints prevent the target from complying even when economic pain is severe.

Economic statecraft also generates second-order effects that can undermine long-term effectiveness. Overuse of financial sanctions may accelerate efforts to create alternatives to dollar-denominated finance—China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) and discussions of central bank digital currencies partly reflect this dynamic. Aggressive use of export controls may spur targeted countries to invest heavily in indigenous alternatives, eventually reducing the sanctioner's leverage—as China is now doing in semiconductors following U.S. restrictions.

### 2.3 Weaponized Interdependence

**Weaponized interdependence** describes the structural condition in which asymmetric network positions in globalized economic systems can be exploited for strategic advantage. This concept, developed by Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman, explains how economic integration—long assumed to promote peace—can actually enable new forms of coercion.

The key insight is that global economic networks have hierarchical structures. Financial transactions concentrate through specific clearing systems (SWIFT for international banking, correspondent banking relationships for dollar transactions). Internet traffic routes through particular hubs (submarine cable landing points, cloud service providers, internet exchange points). Supply chains have critical nodes (Taiwan's TSMC for advanced semiconductors, China's rare earth processing, specific chemical plants for pharmaceutical precursors). These concentration points create power asymmetries: the state with jurisdiction over the hub can see network flows (the panopticon effect) and can deny access to specific actors (the chokepoint effect).

The panopticon effect enables intelligence gathering and enforcement. Because international financial transactions typically route through U.S. correspondent banks or SWIFT (which cooperates closely with U.S. and European authorities), American officials can monitor global financial flows and detect sanctions violations. Because internet traffic often passes through infrastructure under U.S. jurisdiction or operated by American companies, U.S. intelligence agencies have structural advantages in signals intelligence. This visibility itself becomes a source of power.

The chokepoint effect enables coercion. Cutting designated entities off from SWIFT cripples their ability to conduct international business—as Iranian banks discovered in 2012 and Russian banks learned in 2022. Denying access to advanced semiconductors or the equipment to make them constrains development in AI, supercomputing, and advanced weapons systems—the logic behind October 2022 controls on China. Restricting rare earth exports limits production of defense systems, electronics, and renewable energy technologies—China's potential leverage over the West.

Weaponized interdependence differs from traditional economic warfare. It does not require severing economic ties completely (autarky) or imposing comprehensive blockades. Instead, it involves surgical exploitation of specific network vulnerabilities. The United States can maintain substantial trade with China while denying Chinese firms access to specific chokepoint technologies. China can continue exporting manufactured goods while restricting access to specific critical minerals. The coercion targets particular nodes, not entire relationships.

This creates distinctive strategic dynamics. States seek to maximize their hub positions while reducing dependence on rivals' hubs—hence China's emphasis on semiconductor self-sufficiency and development of alternative payment systems, and American efforts to secure rare earth supply chains and reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing for critical goods. The result is partial decoupling: selective disengagement from specific vulnerable dependencies while maintaining broader economic integration where both sides benefit and neither sees critical security risks.

### 2.4 Economic Coercion

**Economic coercion** is the use of economic measures to compel changes in another actor's behavior through the threat or infliction of economic costs. It is the most adversarial form of economic statecraft, aimed at forcing targets to do something (compellence), stop doing something (deterrence), or constraining their capabilities (containment).

Economic coercion involves three elements. First, **an economic measure** that imposes costs: sanctions, export controls, market access restrictions, asset seizures, financial exclusion, or other penalties. Second, **a behavioral objective**: the specific change the coercing state seeks in the target's actions. This might be policy change (end nuclear program, withdraw from occupied territory), leadership change (regime change), or capability degradation (prevent military modernization). Third, **a causal theory** linking the economic pain to behavioral change: the coercer believes the imposed costs will motivate the target to comply.

Economic coercion operates through two mechanisms. **Denial** seeks to prevent the target from accessing resources, technologies, or markets necessary for objectionable activities. Export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment aim to prevent China from developing cutting-edge AI capabilities by denying access to necessary inputs. This does not require the target to choose compliance; it physically prevents the unwanted activity. **Punishment** inflicts costs to change the target's cost-benefit calculation, making continued defiance more painful than compliance. Financial sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine aim to impose sufficient economic pain that Moscow reassesses the costs of continuing the war. This requires the target to choose compliance in response to pain.

Effectiveness is contingent and contested. Economic coercion succeeds when targets comply at acceptable cost to the coercer. But success rates are modest. Research suggests comprehensive sanctions succeed in perhaps 20-30% of cases, with effectiveness varying dramatically based on objective (modest policy changes easier than regime change), target regime type (democracies more vulnerable to economic pain than autocracies), and duration (effectiveness often declines over time as targets adapt). Export controls can effectively deny capabilities if the denied input is critical and cannot be substituted, but targets often find workarounds or develop indigenous alternatives over time.

Economic coercion also generates strategic costs. It may damage commercial interests in the coercing state, alienate allies who bear costs without seeing benefits, provoke retaliation, accelerate target efforts to reduce dependency, or undermine the coercer's long-term leverage by encouraging development of alternative systems. The challenge is achieving objectives before these second-order costs become prohibitive.

Importantly, economic coercion exists on a spectrum. At one end are targeted, reversible measures with clear conditions for relief (sanction specific individuals contingent on specific actions). At the other end are comprehensive efforts to fundamentally constrain rivals' capabilities with no clear off-ramp (wholesale technology decoupling). Most real-world cases fall somewhere between these poles, combining elements of denial and punishment, short-term signaling and long-term strategic competition.

Understanding these distinctions—between geoeconomics as strategic domain, economic statecraft as policy tool, weaponized interdependence as structural condition, and economic coercion as specific practice—provides the conceptual foundation for analyzing the US-China strategic competition and the cases examined in subsequent chapters.
