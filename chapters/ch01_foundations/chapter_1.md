# Chapter 1: Foundations of Economic Statecraft in the 21st Century

## Executive Summary

On October 7, 2022, the United States imposed sweeping export controls targeting China's semiconductor industry. The measures restricted not only American technology and equipment, but also deployed a novel "foreign direct product rule" to prevent any advanced chips made anywhere in the world with US tools from reaching Chinese firms. The action represented economic statecraft on an unprecedented scale—an attempt to use commercial restrictions to constrain a strategic rival's technological development. China's response was equally telling: rather than military escalation, Beijing accelerated its "dual circulation" strategy, launched investigations into American firms under its Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, and tightened export controls on critical minerals like gallium and germanium. This was not traditional economic warfare. It was something new: the systematic weaponization of economic interdependence.

Welcome to the era of geoeconomics. After decades in which economic globalization and security competition seemed to occupy separate spheres, the boundaries have collapsed. Trade relationships, supply chains, technology standards, and financial flows are now instruments of statecraft. Economic coercion—the use of economic measures to compel behavioral changes in other states—has become central to how great powers compete. For policymakers, business leaders, and citizens navigating this landscape, understanding these dynamics is no longer optional.

This book provides a comprehensive guide to economic coercion in the context of US-China strategic competition. It examines how states use economic tools to pursue security objectives, why such measures succeed or fail, and what the proliferation of economic statecraft means for the international system. The focus is practical: each chapter explains specific tools available to governments, analyzes real-world cases, and explores decision-making through tabletop exercises. But the book also takes seriously the need for strategic empathy—understanding how different actors perceive threats, opportunities, and constraints.

Three core arguments organize our analysis. First, contemporary economic coercion reflects the structural condition of weaponized interdependence. Global networks for finance, technology, and trade create chokepoints—nodes of asymmetric dependency that can be exploited for coercive leverage. The United States benefits from centrality in dollar-denominated finance, internet infrastructure, and semiconductor supply chains. China increasingly holds comparable positions in critical minerals, electric vehicle batteries, and manufacturing capacity. Understanding where these chokepoints exist and how they can be leveraged is fundamental to modern statecraft.

Second, effectiveness in economic coercion depends on more than material capability. Success requires understanding target decision-making, managing allied coordination, anticipating retaliation, and sustaining domestic support. The most sophisticated sanctions can fail if targets can adapt, allies defect, or domestic constituencies lose patience. Conversely, seemingly modest restrictions can succeed when they target genuine vulnerabilities and are paired with viable off-ramps. This book develops a framework for analyzing economic coercion across four dimensions: the domain of action (trade, finance, technology, investment), the target (state, firm, individual), the objective (deterrence, compellence, containment, signaling), and the intensity (from diplomatic pressure to comprehensive economic warfare).

Third, and perhaps most importantly, effective strategy requires understanding adversary perspectives. Chinese policymakers do not view American export controls as defensive measures to protect national security. They see them as containment, echoing historical efforts to keep China weak and dependent. This perception—rooted in the "Century of Humiliation" and reinforced by contemporary experience—shapes Beijing's responses. Similarly, American concerns about Chinese economic coercion reflect genuine anxieties about dependency on a strategic competitor. Neither perspective is simply "propaganda." Both reflect real historical experiences and contemporary threat perceptions. Effective policy must account for these divergent worldviews.

This chapter establishes foundations. It defines key concepts—geoeconomics, economic statecraft, weaponized interdependence, and economic coercion—and explains how they relate. It traces the arc of US-China economic relations from engagement through growing competition. It introduces analytical frameworks used throughout the book. And critically, it presents both American and Chinese perspectives on economic statecraft, explaining how different historical experiences produce different strategic logics. The chapter includes two detailed case studies—the Cold War-era Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) and the 2022 exclusion of Russian banks from SWIFT—that illustrate how economic coercion works in practice.

The stakes are high. How the United States and China manage their economic interdependence while competing strategically may determine whether this century sees stable competition or catastrophic conflict. Understanding the tools, limitations, and logic of economic coercion is essential for navigating that challenge.

## Section 1: Introduction - The Return of Economic Statecraft

### 1.1 Opening Vignette: The October 2022 Semiconductor Controls

The meeting was classified, the implications global. In early October 2022, senior officials from the Departments of Commerce, State, Defense, and the National Security Council gathered to finalize the most aggressive peacetime export controls the United States had ever imposed. Their target: China's advanced semiconductor industry and, by extension, its ambitions in artificial intelligence, supercomputing, and military modernization.

The resulting measures, announced on October 7, 2022, were breathtaking in scope. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) added 31 Chinese entities to the Entity List, blocking them from receiving American technology. Far more significantly, BIS imposed sweeping new restrictions on exporting semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China and updated the "foreign direct product rule" (FDPR) to prevent chips made anywhere in the world with American equipment from reaching designated Chinese firms. The controls effectively weaponized America's chokepoint position in the global semiconductor supply chain: no country can produce cutting-edge chips at scale without US equipment, software, and intellectual property.

The measures also contained a remarkable provision targeting people, not just products. Under the new "U.S. person" rule, American citizens and green card holders were prohibited from supporting development or production of advanced chips at Chinese facilities—even those not otherwise subject to U.S. jurisdiction. This represented economic statecraft directed not just at rival governments or companies, but at individual engineers and their career choices.

China's response revealed how deeply these measures struck. State media denounced them as "technological hegemony" and "economic bullying." The Ministry of Commerce announced it would "resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies." More concretely, Beijing accelerated implementation of its "dual circulation" strategy, emphasizing domestic semiconductor development despite massive technical challenges. It launched antitrust and data security investigations into American firms like Micron. And in July 2023, China imposed export controls on gallium and germanium—obscure metals critical for semiconductors and defense applications—demonstrating its own chokepoint leverage.

This episode crystallizes the central dynamic of contemporary great power competition. The United States and China are locked in a struggle over the commanding heights of 21st-century technology, and economic tools have become the primary instruments of that struggle. Neither side launched missiles or moved troops. Instead, they manipulated supply chain dependencies, restricted access to critical inputs, and used regulatory authority to reshape patterns of global commerce. This is economic statecraft in the modern era.

### 1.2 The Paradox of Interdependence

For decades, economic interdependence was assumed to be a pacifying force. The logic was straightforward: countries that trade extensively have shared interests in stability, mutual prosperity, and maintaining open markets. War becomes irrational when it disrupts profitable exchange. This "capitalist peace" thesis underpinned much of post-Cold War Western strategy, particularly toward China. Integrating China into global institutions and supply chains would not only enrich all parties but also make conflict prohibitively costly.

The paradox is that interdependence creates both constraints and opportunities. Yes, economic integration raises the costs of conflict. But it also creates asymmetric dependencies—structural vulnerabilities that can be exploited for coercive leverage. When one country controls chokepoints in critical networks, it can weaponize those positions to extract concessions, punish adversaries, or constrain rivals' strategic options. Rather than preventing coercion, interdependence can enable it.

Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman's concept of "weaponized interdependence" captures this dynamic. Global networks—for finance, trade, technology, information—are not evenly distributed. They have hubs: nodes of concentration where transactions must pass through specific institutions, platforms, or jurisdictions. The United States sits at the center of dollar-denominated finance (SWIFT system, correspondent banking), internet infrastructure (submarine cables, cloud services, DNS root servers), and advanced technology supply chains (semiconductors, software, aerospace). China increasingly occupies comparable positions in rare earth processing, electric vehicle batteries, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and certain manufacturing supply chains.

These hub positions create what Farrell and Newman call "panopticon" and "chokepoint" effects. The panopticon effect allows the hub state to see network flows—monitoring transactions, communications, and exchanges. The chokepoint effect allows it to deny access—blocking specific actors from the network or withholding critical inputs. Both capabilities can be weaponized: surveillance enables intelligence gathering and sanctions enforcement, while denial enables coercion.

The result is a fundamental tension. Economic integration does constrain: sanctioning China's semiconductor industry imposes costs on American firms (lost sales, reduced economies of scale) and allies (disrupted supply chains, technology restrictions). But integration also empowers: without reliance on U.S. semiconductor equipment, American controls would have no bite. The same interdependence that creates peace constituencies also creates coercive leverage.

This paradox generates strategic dilemmas. How much economic integration is optimal when potential adversaries are involved? Should states prioritize economic efficiency or strategic autonomy? Can chokepoint dependencies be maintained without provoking retaliation or accelerating rivals' efforts at self-sufficiency? These questions have no easy answers, but understanding the dual nature of interdependence is essential for navigating them.

### 1.3 Why Now? Four Structural Drivers

Economic coercion is not new. Imperial Britain used trade restrictions and naval blockades. The United States orchestrated Cold War export controls through CoCom. Economic sanctions have long been a staple of foreign policy. Yet the current era is distinctive in the intensity, sophistication, and centrality of economic statecraft. Four structural factors explain why.

**First: The rise of China as a peer economic competitor.** For the first time since 1945, the United States faces a rival with comparable economic scale and technological ambition. China is the world's largest trading nation, its second-largest economy, and increasingly a technological frontier state in domains from 5G to artificial intelligence to electric vehicles. This creates both motivation and capability for economic competition. The U.S. cannot ignore China's economic power, and China cannot accept permanent technological subordination. Economic coercion becomes a primary mechanism for managing this rivalry short of military conflict.

**Second: The digitalization and networkization of economic activity.** Modern economies run on digital networks: financial transactions through SWIFT and correspondent banking, internet traffic through submarine cables and cloud platforms, manufacturing through complex supply chains coordinated by enterprise software. This digitalization amplifies chokepoint effects. Cutting a country off from SWIFT is far more effective than historical financial sanctions because modern finance is fundamentally networked. Similarly, denying access to advanced chips or cloud services can cripple development in AI, quantum computing, and other strategic technologies in ways that Cold War-era export controls on machine tools could not.

**Third: The fragmentation of the liberal international order.** During the unipolar moment of the 1990s and early 2000s, the United States could largely shape global rules in ways that served its interests. Institutions like the WTO, IMF, and World Bank embedded American preferences. Today, that consensus has fractured. China offers alternative institutions (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Belt and Road Initiative) and contests existing rules. The result is a more contested economic order where states increasingly use economic tools to reshape rules and institutions in their favor, rather than accepting a single set of neutral market principles.

**Fourth: The blurring of economic and security domains.** Emerging technologies increasingly have dual-use applications: artificial intelligence enhances both facial recognition apps and autonomous weapons systems; quantum computing promises breakthroughs in drug discovery and code-breaking; biotechnology enables personalized medicine and biological weapons. This dual-use character means that commercial competition in cutting-edge technologies is inseparable from security competition. States cannot afford to treat trade, investment, and technology development as purely economic matters when those same capabilities determine military effectiveness and intelligence dominance.

Together, these four factors—peer economic competition with China, networked digital economies, fragmentation of the liberal order, and dual-use technology convergence—create an environment where economic coercion is both more feasible and more necessary as a tool of statecraft. Understanding this structural context is essential for making sense of specific policy choices, from semiconductor export controls to rare earth restrictions to financial sanctions.

The remainder of this chapter builds on this foundation. We first define key concepts precisely (geoeconomics, economic statecraft, weaponized interdependence, economic coercion). We then examine the arc of US-China economic relations and the specific strategic perspectives each side brings. Finally, we develop analytical frameworks for understanding when and how economic coercion works—frameworks that will be applied throughout the book's subsequent chapters.
