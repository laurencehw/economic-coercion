# Chapter 1: Foundations of Economic Statecraft in the 21st Century

## Executive Summary

On October 7, 2022, the United States imposed sweeping export controls targeting China's semiconductor industry. The measures restricted not only American technology and equipment, but also deployed a novel "foreign direct product rule" to prevent any advanced chips made anywhere in the world with US tools from reaching Chinese firms. The action represented economic statecraft on an unprecedented scale—an attempt to use commercial restrictions to constrain a strategic rival's technological development. China's response was equally telling: rather than military escalation, Beijing accelerated its "dual circulation" strategy, launched investigations into American firms under its Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, and tightened export controls on critical minerals like gallium and germanium. This was not traditional economic warfare. It was something new: the systematic weaponization of economic interdependence.

Welcome to the era of geoeconomics. After decades in which economic globalization and security competition seemed to occupy separate spheres, the boundaries have collapsed. Trade relationships, supply chains, technology standards, and financial flows are now instruments of statecraft. Economic coercion—the use of economic measures to compel behavioral changes in other states—has become central to how great powers compete. For policymakers, business leaders, and citizens navigating this landscape, understanding these dynamics is no longer optional.

This book provides a comprehensive guide to economic coercion in the context of US-China strategic competition. It examines how states use economic tools to pursue security objectives, why such measures succeed or fail, and what the proliferation of economic statecraft means for the international system. The focus is practical: each chapter explains specific tools available to governments, analyzes real-world cases, and explores decision-making through tabletop exercises. But the book also takes seriously the need for strategic empathy—understanding how different actors perceive threats, opportunities, and constraints.

Three core arguments organize our analysis. First, contemporary economic coercion reflects the structural condition of weaponized interdependence. Global networks for finance, technology, and trade create chokepoints—nodes of asymmetric dependency that can be exploited for coercive leverage. The United States benefits from centrality in dollar-denominated finance, internet infrastructure, and semiconductor supply chains. China increasingly holds comparable positions in critical minerals, electric vehicle batteries, and manufacturing capacity. Understanding where these chokepoints exist and how they can be leveraged is fundamental to modern statecraft.

Second, effectiveness in economic coercion depends on more than material capability. Success requires understanding target decision-making, managing allied coordination, anticipating retaliation, and sustaining domestic support. The most sophisticated sanctions can fail if targets can adapt, allies defect, or domestic constituencies lose patience. Conversely, seemingly modest restrictions can succeed when they target genuine vulnerabilities and are paired with viable off-ramps. This book develops a framework for analyzing economic coercion across four dimensions: the domain of action (trade, finance, technology, investment), the target (state, firm, individual), the objective (deterrence, compellence, containment, signaling), and the intensity (from diplomatic pressure to comprehensive economic warfare).

Third, and perhaps most importantly, effective strategy requires understanding adversary perspectives. Chinese policymakers do not view American export controls as defensive measures to protect national security. They see them as containment, echoing historical efforts to keep China weak and dependent. This perception—rooted in the "Century of Humiliation" and reinforced by contemporary experience—shapes Beijing's responses. Similarly, American concerns about Chinese economic coercion reflect genuine anxieties about dependency on a strategic competitor. Neither perspective is simply "propaganda." Both reflect real historical experiences and contemporary threat perceptions. Effective policy must account for these divergent worldviews.

This chapter establishes foundations. It defines key concepts—geoeconomics, economic statecraft, weaponized interdependence, and economic coercion—and explains how they relate. It traces the arc of US-China economic relations from engagement through growing competition. It introduces analytical frameworks used throughout the book. And critically, it presents both American and Chinese perspectives on economic statecraft, explaining how different historical experiences produce different strategic logics. The chapter includes two detailed case studies—the Cold War-era Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) and the 2022 exclusion of Russian banks from SWIFT—that illustrate how economic coercion works in practice.

The stakes are high. How the United States and China manage their economic interdependence while competing strategically may determine whether this century sees stable competition or catastrophic conflict. Understanding the tools, limitations, and logic of economic coercion is essential for navigating that challenge.

## Section 1: Introduction - The Return of Economic Statecraft

### 1.1 Opening Vignette: The October 2022 Semiconductor Controls

The meeting was classified, the implications global. In early October 2022, senior officials from the Departments of Commerce, State, Defense, and the National Security Council gathered to finalize the most aggressive peacetime export controls the United States had ever imposed. Their target: China's advanced semiconductor industry and, by extension, its ambitions in artificial intelligence, supercomputing, and military modernization.

The resulting measures, announced on October 7, 2022, were breathtaking in scope. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) added 31 Chinese entities to the Entity List, blocking them from receiving American technology. Far more significantly, BIS imposed sweeping new restrictions on exporting semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China and updated the "foreign direct product rule" (FDPR) to prevent chips made anywhere in the world with American equipment from reaching designated Chinese firms. The controls effectively weaponized America's chokepoint position in the global semiconductor supply chain: no country can produce cutting-edge chips at scale without US equipment, software, and intellectual property.

The measures also contained a remarkable provision targeting people, not just products. Under the new "U.S. person" rule, American citizens and green card holders were prohibited from supporting development or production of advanced chips at Chinese facilities—even those not otherwise subject to U.S. jurisdiction. This represented economic statecraft directed not just at rival governments or companies, but at individual engineers and their career choices.

China's response revealed how deeply these measures struck. State media denounced them as "technological hegemony" and "economic bullying." The Ministry of Commerce announced it would "resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies." More concretely, Beijing accelerated implementation of its "dual circulation" strategy, emphasizing domestic semiconductor development despite massive technical challenges. It launched antitrust and data security investigations into American firms like Micron. And in July 2023, China imposed export controls on gallium and germanium—obscure metals critical for semiconductors and defense applications—demonstrating its own chokepoint leverage.

This episode crystallizes the central dynamic of contemporary great power competition. The United States and China are locked in a struggle over the commanding heights of 21st-century technology, and economic tools have become the primary instruments of that struggle. Neither side launched missiles or moved troops. Instead, they manipulated supply chain dependencies, restricted access to critical inputs, and used regulatory authority to reshape patterns of global commerce. This is economic statecraft in the modern era.

### 1.2 The Paradox of Interdependence

For decades, economic interdependence was assumed to be a pacifying force. The logic was straightforward: countries that trade extensively have shared interests in stability, mutual prosperity, and maintaining open markets. War becomes irrational when it disrupts profitable exchange. This "capitalist peace" thesis underpinned much of post-Cold War Western strategy, particularly toward China. Integrating China into global institutions and supply chains would not only enrich all parties but also make conflict prohibitively costly.

The paradox is that interdependence creates both constraints and opportunities. Yes, economic integration raises the costs of conflict. But it also creates asymmetric dependencies—structural vulnerabilities that can be exploited for coercive leverage. When one country controls chokepoints in critical networks, it can weaponize those positions to extract concessions, punish adversaries, or constrain rivals' strategic options. Rather than preventing coercion, interdependence can enable it.

Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman's concept of "weaponized interdependence" captures this dynamic. Global networks—for finance, trade, technology, information—are not evenly distributed. They have hubs: nodes of concentration where transactions must pass through specific institutions, platforms, or jurisdictions. The United States sits at the center of dollar-denominated finance (SWIFT system, correspondent banking), internet infrastructure (submarine cables, cloud services, DNS root servers), and advanced technology supply chains (semiconductors, software, aerospace). China increasingly occupies comparable positions in rare earth processing, electric vehicle batteries, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and certain manufacturing supply chains.

These hub positions create what Farrell and Newman call "panopticon" and "chokepoint" effects. The panopticon effect allows the hub state to see network flows—monitoring transactions, communications, and exchanges. The chokepoint effect allows it to deny access—blocking specific actors from the network or withholding critical inputs. Both capabilities can be weaponized: surveillance enables intelligence gathering and sanctions enforcement, while denial enables coercion.

The result is a fundamental tension. Economic integration does constrain: sanctioning China's semiconductor industry imposes costs on American firms (lost sales, reduced economies of scale) and allies (disrupted supply chains, technology restrictions). But integration also empowers: without reliance on U.S. semiconductor equipment, American controls would have no bite. The same interdependence that creates peace constituencies also creates coercive leverage.

This paradox generates strategic dilemmas. How much economic integration is optimal when potential adversaries are involved? Should states prioritize economic efficiency or strategic autonomy? Can chokepoint dependencies be maintained without provoking retaliation or accelerating rivals' efforts at self-sufficiency? These questions have no easy answers, but understanding the dual nature of interdependence is essential for navigating them.

### 1.3 Why Now? Four Structural Drivers

Economic coercion is not new. Imperial Britain used trade restrictions and naval blockades. The United States orchestrated Cold War export controls through CoCom. Economic sanctions have long been a staple of foreign policy. Yet the current era is distinctive in the intensity, sophistication, and centrality of economic statecraft. Four structural factors explain why.

**First: The rise of China as a peer economic competitor.** For the first time since 1945, the United States faces a rival with comparable economic scale and technological ambition. China is the world's largest trading nation, its second-largest economy, and increasingly a technological frontier state in domains from 5G to artificial intelligence to electric vehicles. This creates both motivation and capability for economic competition. The U.S. cannot ignore China's economic power, and China cannot accept permanent technological subordination. Economic coercion becomes a primary mechanism for managing this rivalry short of military conflict.

**Second: The digitalization and networkization of economic activity.** Modern economies run on digital networks: financial transactions through SWIFT and correspondent banking, internet traffic through submarine cables and cloud platforms, manufacturing through complex supply chains coordinated by enterprise software. This digitalization amplifies chokepoint effects. Cutting a country off from SWIFT is far more effective than historical financial sanctions because modern finance is fundamentally networked. Similarly, denying access to advanced chips or cloud services can cripple development in AI, quantum computing, and other strategic technologies in ways that Cold War-era export controls on machine tools could not.

**Third: The fragmentation of the liberal international order.** During the unipolar moment of the 1990s and early 2000s, the United States could largely shape global rules in ways that served its interests. Institutions like the WTO, IMF, and World Bank embedded American preferences. Today, that consensus has fractured. China offers alternative institutions (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Belt and Road Initiative) and contests existing rules. The result is a more contested economic order where states increasingly use economic tools to reshape rules and institutions in their favor, rather than accepting a single set of neutral market principles.

**Fourth: The blurring of economic and security domains.** Emerging technologies increasingly have dual-use applications: artificial intelligence enhances both facial recognition apps and autonomous weapons systems; quantum computing promises breakthroughs in drug discovery and code-breaking; biotechnology enables personalized medicine and biological weapons. This dual-use character means that commercial competition in cutting-edge technologies is inseparable from security competition. States cannot afford to treat trade, investment, and technology development as purely economic matters when those same capabilities determine military effectiveness and intelligence dominance.

Together, these four factors—peer economic competition with China, networked digital economies, fragmentation of the liberal order, and dual-use technology convergence—create an environment where economic coercion is both more feasible and more necessary as a tool of statecraft. Understanding this structural context is essential for making sense of specific policy choices, from semiconductor export controls to rare earth restrictions to financial sanctions.

The remainder of this chapter builds on this foundation. We first define key concepts precisely (geoeconomics, economic statecraft, weaponized interdependence, economic coercion). We then examine the arc of US-China economic relations and the specific strategic perspectives each side brings. Finally, we develop analytical frameworks for understanding when and how economic coercion works—frameworks that will be applied throughout the book's subsequent chapters.

## Section 2: Defining Key Concepts

Precision matters. The terms "geoeconomics," "economic statecraft," "weaponized interdependence," and "economic coercion" are often used interchangeably in policy debates, but they describe distinct—though related—phenomena. Clear definitions enable clearer thinking about when, why, and how states use economic power for strategic purposes.

### 2.1 Geoeconomics

**Geoeconomics** refers to the use of economic instruments to produce geopolitical outcomes. The term was coined by Edward Luttwak in the early 1990s to describe how states compete for power and influence through economic means in an era when military competition among major powers had become prohibitively risky. Where geopolitics is about the relationship between geography, power, and strategy, geoeconomics applies that logic to economic domains: trade, investment, finance, technology, and resources.

Geoeconomic competition manifests in several ways. States may use trade policy to build spheres of influence—consider China's Belt and Road Initiative, which uses infrastructure investment and trade relationships to expand Beijing's political influence across Eurasia, Africa, and Latin America. They may weaponize access to their markets—the European Union uses the threat of excluding firms from its large consumer market to impose regulatory standards globally, what Anu Bradford calls the "Brussels Effect." They may compete for dominance in strategic industries—U.S.-China rivalry over 5G telecommunications reflects both sides' recognition that whoever sets standards for next-generation communications infrastructure gains strategic advantage. Or they may seek control over critical resources—competition for rare earth minerals, semiconductor supply chains, and energy transit routes all reflect geoeconomic logics.

The geoeconomic lens reveals three key dynamics. First, economic power is relative, not just absolute. What matters is not just a country's GDP, but its ability to shape global economic rules, control chokepoints in networks, and withstand pressure. China's GDP may be substantial, but its dependence on imported semiconductors creates vulnerability despite its overall economic size. Second, economic interdependence creates strategic opportunities and vulnerabilities. States simultaneously seek to maximize others' dependence on them while minimizing their own dependence on potential adversaries. Third, economic and security domains are deeply intertwined. Commercial competition in emerging technologies directly affects military balances, intelligence capabilities, and economic resilience.

Geoeconomics is not inherently adversarial. States can use economic tools to build partnerships, reward friends, and create positive-sum outcomes. The Marshall Plan exemplified geoeconomic strategy aimed at reconstruction and alliance-building, not coercion. Contemporary development finance and trade agreements often serve similar purposes. But in an era of great power competition, the competitive and coercive dimensions of geoeconomics have become increasingly prominent.

The shift toward geoeconomic competition reflects structural changes in the international system. During the Cold War, the economic and security spheres were substantially decoupled: the West traded internally, the Communist bloc did likewise, and military competition dominated superpower relations. Today, the United States and China are deeply economically integrated while simultaneously engaged in strategic competition. This creates demand for geoeconomic tools—economic measures that can advance security objectives without triggering military escalation.

### 2.2 Economic Statecraft

**Economic statecraft** is the subset of geoeconomics focused on deliberate government policies using economic tools to achieve foreign policy objectives. Where geoeconomics describes a broad strategic domain, economic statecraft refers to specific policy instruments and their application.

David Baldwin's classic definition frames economic statecraft as "influence attempts relying primarily on resources which have a reasonable semblance of a market price in terms of money." This encompasses both positive inducements (foreign aid, preferential trade agreements, investment, debt relief) and negative sanctions (trade restrictions, asset freezes, financial exclusion, technology denial). The key is intentionality: economic statecraft involves purposeful government action to achieve specific foreign policy goals through economic means.

Economic statecraft operates across multiple domains. In the **trade domain**, tools include tariffs, quotas, export controls, import bans, and preferential trade agreements. The United States uses export controls to prevent advanced technology from reaching rivals; China uses informal trade restrictions to punish countries for political decisions it opposes (see the 2010 rare earth export restrictions after Japan detained a Chinese fishing captain, or the 2020-2021 trade restrictions on Australia following Canberra's calls for a COVID-19 investigation). In the **financial domain**, statecraft includes sanctions, asset freezes, exclusion from payment systems (SWIFT), secondary sanctions on third parties doing business with targets, and restrictions on dollar access. U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) maintains multiple sanctions programs targeting countries (Iran, North Korea, Russia), entities, and individuals. In the **investment domain**, tools include foreign direct investment screening, forced divestment, restrictions on portfolio investment, and development finance. CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) reviews foreign acquisitions of American firms for national security implications. In the **technology domain**, statecraft encompasses export controls, investment restrictions, talent restrictions, standard-setting, and technology transfer requirements. The October 2022 semiconductor controls exemplify technology statecraft.

Effectiveness varies dramatically across contexts. Economic statecraft succeeds when it changes target behavior in desired ways at acceptable cost. Success depends on several factors: the target's vulnerability (is the sanctioned good/service critical and difficult to substitute?), the sanctioner's credibility (will threatened measures actually be imposed?), allied coordination (can the target find alternative suppliers?), and target decision-making (does the target regime value the benefits of compliance more than the political costs?). Many sanctions fail because targets can adapt, allies defect, or political constraints prevent the target from complying even when economic pain is severe.

Economic statecraft also generates second-order effects that can undermine long-term effectiveness. Overuse of financial sanctions may accelerate efforts to create alternatives to dollar-denominated finance—China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) and discussions of central bank digital currencies partly reflect this dynamic. Aggressive use of export controls may spur targeted countries to invest heavily in indigenous alternatives, eventually reducing the sanctioner's leverage—as China is now doing in semiconductors following U.S. restrictions.

### 2.3 Weaponized Interdependence

**Weaponized interdependence** describes the structural condition in which asymmetric network positions in globalized economic systems can be exploited for strategic advantage. This concept, developed by Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman, explains how economic integration—long assumed to promote peace—can actually enable new forms of coercion.

The key insight is that global economic networks have hierarchical structures. Financial transactions concentrate through specific clearing systems (SWIFT for international banking, correspondent banking relationships for dollar transactions). Internet traffic routes through particular hubs (submarine cable landing points, cloud service providers, internet exchange points). Supply chains have critical nodes (Taiwan's TSMC for advanced semiconductors, China's rare earth processing, specific chemical plants for pharmaceutical precursors). These concentration points create power asymmetries: the state with jurisdiction over the hub can see network flows (the panopticon effect) and can deny access to specific actors (the chokepoint effect).

The panopticon effect enables intelligence gathering and enforcement. Because international financial transactions typically route through U.S. correspondent banks or SWIFT (which cooperates closely with U.S. and European authorities), American officials can monitor global financial flows and detect sanctions violations. Because internet traffic often passes through infrastructure under U.S. jurisdiction or operated by American companies, U.S. intelligence agencies have structural advantages in signals intelligence. This visibility itself becomes a source of power.

The chokepoint effect enables coercion. Cutting designated entities off from SWIFT cripples their ability to conduct international business—as Iranian banks discovered in 2012 and Russian banks learned in 2022. Denying access to advanced semiconductors or the equipment to make them constrains development in AI, supercomputing, and advanced weapons systems—the logic behind October 2022 controls on China. Restricting rare earth exports limits production of defense systems, electronics, and renewable energy technologies—China's potential leverage over the West.

Weaponized interdependence differs from traditional economic warfare. It does not require severing economic ties completely (autarky) or imposing comprehensive blockades. Instead, it involves surgical exploitation of specific network vulnerabilities. The United States can maintain substantial trade with China while denying Chinese firms access to specific chokepoint technologies. China can continue exporting manufactured goods while restricting access to specific critical minerals. The coercion targets particular nodes, not entire relationships.

This creates distinctive strategic dynamics. States seek to maximize their hub positions while reducing dependence on rivals' hubs—hence China's emphasis on semiconductor self-sufficiency and development of alternative payment systems, and American efforts to secure rare earth supply chains and reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing for critical goods. The result is partial decoupling: selective disengagement from specific vulnerable dependencies while maintaining broader economic integration where both sides benefit and neither sees critical security risks.

### 2.4 Economic Coercion

**Economic coercion** is the use of economic measures to compel changes in another actor's behavior through the threat or infliction of economic costs. It is the most adversarial form of economic statecraft, aimed at forcing targets to do something (compellence), stop doing something (deterrence), or constraining their capabilities (containment).

Economic coercion involves three elements. First, **an economic measure** that imposes costs: sanctions, export controls, market access restrictions, asset seizures, financial exclusion, or other penalties. Second, **a behavioral objective**: the specific change the coercing state seeks in the target's actions. This might be policy change (end nuclear program, withdraw from occupied territory), leadership change (regime change), or capability degradation (prevent military modernization). Third, **a causal theory** linking the economic pain to behavioral change: the coercer believes the imposed costs will motivate the target to comply.

Economic coercion operates through two mechanisms. **Denial** seeks to prevent the target from accessing resources, technologies, or markets necessary for objectionable activities. Export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment aim to prevent China from developing cutting-edge AI capabilities by denying access to necessary inputs. This does not require the target to choose compliance; it physically prevents the unwanted activity. **Punishment** inflicts costs to change the target's cost-benefit calculation, making continued defiance more painful than compliance. Financial sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine aim to impose sufficient economic pain that Moscow reassesses the costs of continuing the war. This requires the target to choose compliance in response to pain.

Effectiveness is contingent and contested. Economic coercion succeeds when targets comply at acceptable cost to the coercer. But success rates are modest. Research suggests comprehensive sanctions succeed in perhaps 20-30% of cases, with effectiveness varying dramatically based on objective (modest policy changes easier than regime change), target regime type (democracies more vulnerable to economic pain than autocracies), and duration (effectiveness often declines over time as targets adapt). Export controls can effectively deny capabilities if the denied input is critical and cannot be substituted, but targets often find workarounds or develop indigenous alternatives over time.

Economic coercion also generates strategic costs. It may damage commercial interests in the coercing state, alienate allies who bear costs without seeing benefits, provoke retaliation, accelerate target efforts to reduce dependency, or undermine the coercer's long-term leverage by encouraging development of alternative systems. The challenge is achieving objectives before these second-order costs become prohibitive.

Importantly, economic coercion exists on a spectrum. At one end are targeted, reversible measures with clear conditions for relief (sanction specific individuals contingent on specific actions). At the other end are comprehensive efforts to fundamentally constrain rivals' capabilities with no clear off-ramp (wholesale technology decoupling). Most real-world cases fall somewhere between these poles, combining elements of denial and punishment, short-term signaling and long-term strategic competition.

Understanding these distinctions—between geoeconomics as strategic domain, economic statecraft as policy tool, weaponized interdependence as structural condition, and economic coercion as specific practice—provides the conceptual foundation for analyzing the US-China strategic competition and the cases examined in subsequent chapters.

## Section 3: The US-China Strategic Competition

The US-China relationship is the central axis of contemporary geoeconomic competition. No other bilateral relationship involves comparable economic interdependence combined with strategic rivalry. Understanding how these two powers reached this point—and how each conceptualizes the competition—is essential for analyzing specific instances of economic coercion.

### 3.1 The Arc of US-China Economic Relations

The trajectory from partnership to competition unfolded over four decades in three distinct phases.

#### Phase 1: Strategic Engagement (1979-2008)

The normalization of US-China relations in 1979 opened an era of deepening economic integration premised on shared strategic interests and mutual benefit. Initially, the relationship was primarily geopolitical: both countries sought to balance against the Soviet Union. But economic engagement quickly became central to the relationship's logic.

American policymakers embraced a theory of transformative engagement: integrating China into the global economy and international institutions would not only create prosperity but would also promote political liberalization and responsible international behavior. As President Clinton argued in 2000 when advocating for China's WTO accession, "by joining the WTO, China is not simply agreeing to import more of our products; it is agreeing to import one of democracy's most cherished values: economic freedom... When individuals have the power... to realize their dreams, they will demand a greater say."

China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 accelerated integration dramatically. Trade between the US and China grew from $116 billion in 2000 to over $560 billion by 2008. American companies invested heavily in Chinese manufacturing, taking advantage of low labor costs and increasingly sophisticated supply chains. China became "the world's factory," integral to global production networks for electronics, apparel, machinery, and countless other goods. The relationship appeared to validate the liberal assumption that economic interdependence promotes cooperation.

But integration also created structural dependencies and distributional consequences that would later fuel tensions. American manufacturing employment declined sharply—research by Autor, Dorn, and Hanson estimated that competition from Chinese imports eliminated 2.4 million U.S. jobs between 1999 and 2011. China accumulated massive foreign exchange reserves ($2 trillion by 2008) and became the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities, creating mutual financial dependencies. Technology transfer—sometimes voluntary through joint ventures, sometimes coerced through requirements for market access, sometimes illicit through cyber espionage—accelerated China's industrial upgrading.

For China, this period represented a strategic opportunity. Deng Xiaoping's guidance to "hide capabilities and bide time" (韬光养晦, tāoguāng yǎnghuì) meant avoiding confrontation while building comprehensive national power. Economic growth became the foundation for eventual great power status. The strategy worked remarkably: China sustained average annual GDP growth above 10%, lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty while building infrastructure and industrial capacity on an unprecedented scale.

#### Phase 2: Growing Tensions (2008-2016)

The 2008 financial crisis marked an inflection point. As Western economies struggled, China maintained growth through massive fiscal stimulus. Chinese leaders drew the lesson that the Western model was not inevitable and that China's state-guided approach might be superior for certain developmental challenges. Confidence grew that the "East is rising, West is declining" (东升西降, dōng shēng xī jiàng).

This confidence manifested in more assertive Chinese economic statecraft. In 2010, following Japan's detention of a Chinese fishing captain near the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, China imposed informal restrictions on rare earth exports to Japan—a clear instance of economic coercion. In 2012, after the EU imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese solar panels, Beijing launched an investigation into European wine exports. These episodes signaled willingness to use economic leverage for geopolitical purposes.

Simultaneously, American concerns about Chinese economic practices intensified. Complaints centered on several issues: intellectual property theft through cyber espionage (highlighted by the 2013 Mandiant report on PLA Unit 61398), forced technology transfer requirements for firms operating in China, industrial subsidies that created overcapacity in strategic sectors (steel, aluminum, solar), and currency manipulation that disadvantaged American manufacturers. The Obama administration pursued these concerns through WTO dispute settlement and diplomatic pressure, but frustration mounted that China was not playing by expected rules despite WTO membership.

China's announcement of "Made in China 2025" in 2015 crystallized Western anxieties. The industrial policy aimed for Chinese leadership in ten strategic sectors: information technology, robotics, aerospace, maritime equipment, advanced rail, new energy vehicles, power equipment, agricultural machinery, new materials, and biopharma. Western analysts saw this not as normal industrial policy but as a blueprint for technological dominance backed by massive state subsidies, technology transfer requirements, and possible exclusion of foreign competitors. The program made explicit China's intention to reduce dependence on Western technology while capturing commanding heights in emerging industries.

Economically, interdependence continued deepening. By 2016, US-China trade exceeded $650 billion annually. American companies earned substantial revenue in China (Apple, GM, Boeing, Starbucks all counted China as a top-three market). Chinese firms increasingly operated in the US, from Lenovo's acquisition of IBM's PC business to growing Chinese direct investment in American real estate, technology, and infrastructure. But the political consensus supporting engagement had fractured.

#### Phase 3: Strategic Competition (2017-Present)

The Trump administration's arrival in 2017 marked a decisive shift from engagement to competition. The 2017 National Security Strategy explicitly designated China a "strategic competitor" seeking to "challenge American power, influence, and interests" and to "erode American security and prosperity." This represented a fundamental reframing: China was no longer a partner to be integrated but a rival to be countered.

Economic statecraft became the primary domain of competition. The Trump administration imposed sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods (eventually covering roughly $370 billion in imports), justified partly on trade grounds (reducing the bilateral deficit) but increasingly on strategic grounds (protecting American technology, reducing dependencies). China retaliated with tariffs on American agricultural products and industrial goods. The "trade war" of 2018-2019 demonstrated both sides' willingness to impose substantial economic costs in pursuit of strategic objectives.

But tariffs were only the most visible component. More consequentially, the U.S. began systematically restricting Chinese access to advanced technology. The 2018 Export Control Reform Act (ECRA) and Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) expanded authority to control technology exports and screen foreign investment. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security added Chinese firms to the Entity List, blocking access to American technology: Huawei and ZTE in 2018-2019, advanced semiconductor firms SMIC and YMTC in 2020-2022. The October 2022 semiconductor controls, discussed earlier, represented the culmination of this approach—comprehensive effort to prevent China from accessing chokepoint technologies for advanced computing.

The Biden administration maintained and expanded this technology competition despite relaxing some tariffs. The 2022 CHIPS and Science Act provided $52 billion for domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research, with explicit prohibitions on recipients expanding advanced semiconductor production in China. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act included substantial subsidies for electric vehicle and battery production, with requirements limiting Chinese content to qualify for benefits. Export controls expanded to cover quantum computing, advanced AI chips, and biotech equipment. The framework shifted from simply restricting China to proactively building American and allied advantages in strategic technologies—what National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan called "running faster" while maintaining "as large a lead as possible."

China responded with its own measures. Beijing accelerated implementation of its "dual circulation" strategy (双循环, shuāng xúnhuán), emphasizing domestic consumption and indigenous innovation to reduce vulnerability to external pressure. It passed the Export Control Law (2020), the Data Security Law (2021), and the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law (2021), creating legal frameworks for economic countermeasures. It imposed export restrictions on critical minerals (gallium, germanium, rare earths) and launched security reviews of American firms operating in China (Micron banned from critical infrastructure in 2023). Most importantly, it made semiconductor self-sufficiency a national priority, investing massive resources in domestic chip production despite technical challenges.

The result is a partial decoupling: selective disengagement from specific dependencies deemed strategically risky, while maintaining broader economic integration where both sides benefit. Total bilateral trade actually increased to over $750 billion by 2022 despite tensions. But the composition is changing—trade in advanced technology products declining, scrutiny of investment intensifying, and both sides building redundancy in critical supply chains.

### 3.2 China's Economic Power and Strategic Objectives

China brings formidable economic capabilities to this competition. It is the world's second-largest economy ($18 trillion GDP in 2023), largest trading nation ($6 trillion in goods trade annually), largest manufacturer (28% of global manufacturing output), and increasingly a technology frontier state. This economic scale creates multiple sources of leverage.

**Market access** is perhaps China's most immediate form of power. With 1.4 billion people and a growing middle class, China offers a market no major multinational can ignore. This creates dependencies: Boeing derives roughly 25% of revenue from Chinese customers, U.S. agricultural exports to China exceed $30 billion annually, GM sells more cars in China than in the United States. Beijing can weaponize this access through regulations, investigations, informal pressure on consumers (calls to boycott foreign brands), or explicit restrictions. Australia experienced this in 2020-2021 when China imposed trade restrictions on barley, wine, coal, and other exports following Canberra's call for a COVID-19 investigation.

**Manufacturing dominance** in critical goods creates chokepoint leverage. China produces 85% of global rare earth elements (critical for magnets in defense systems, electronics, and wind turbines), 70% of lithium-ion batteries (essential for electric vehicles and energy storage), and 60% of solar panels. It dominates production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for many essential medicines. This concentration means disrupting Chinese supply can cause immediate shortages in key industries—as Western countries discovered during COVID-19 when dependence on Chinese personal protective equipment and pharmaceutical inputs became apparent.

**Technology advancement** in specific domains creates competitive advantages. While China lags in cutting-edge semiconductors and certain aerospace technologies, it leads or competes at the frontier in 5G telecommunications (Huawei), high-speed rail, electric vehicles and batteries (BYD, CATL), commercial drones (DJI), certain AI applications (facial recognition, natural language processing), and quantum communications. This heterogeneous technology landscape means neither the US nor China enjoys across-the-board dominance.

**Financial resources** enable global influence. With over $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, China can provide substantial development finance through Belt and Road Initiative, extending infrastructure loans to over 140 countries totaling an estimated $1 trillion since 2013. This creates political influence and potential dependencies: recipient countries may hesitate to oppose Chinese preferences if they need continued financing or rescheduling of existing debts.

China's strategic objectives in economic statecraft center on three imperatives. First, **national rejuvenation** (中华民族伟大复兴, Zhōnghuá mínzú wěidà fùxīng)—Xi Jinping's defining goal of restoring China to great power status by the centenary of the People's Republic in 2049. This requires sustained economic growth, technological advancement, and freedom from external constraints. Second, **technology self-sufficiency** (科技自立自强, kējì zìlì zìqiáng)—reducing dependence on Western technology in strategic domains to prevent chokepoint vulnerability. The semiconductor push exemplifies this priority. Third, **resistance to containment**—preventing the formation of a Western coalition that could constrain Chinese development, much as CoCom constrained Soviet technological advancement during the Cold War. Economic statecraft serves all three objectives: building capabilities, reducing vulnerabilities, and contesting U.S. efforts at technological restriction.

### 3.3 The US Position and Strategic Objectives

The United States brings different but complementary sources of economic power. While no longer the dominant manufacturer, the U.S. maintains critical chokepoints in advanced technology supply chains, global finance, and institutional rule-making.

**Technology chokepoints** remain America's primary economic leverage. U.S. firms dominate in semiconductor design (Intel, AMD, Nvidia), electronic design automation software essential for chip design (Synopsys, Cadence, Mentor Graphics—all American), cloud computing (AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud), operating systems (Microsoft, Apple), and advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment (Applied Materials, Lam Research, KLA). Denying access to these chokepoint technologies can severely constrain rivals' technological development—the October 2022 controls leveraged exactly these positions.

**Financial centrality** provides surveillance and coercive capabilities. The dollar remains the dominant global reserve currency (58% of global reserves), most international transactions use dollar-denominated instruments requiring access to U.S. correspondent banks, and SWIFT cooperates closely with U.S. authorities. This enables both panopticon effects (monitoring global financial flows) and chokepoint effects (cutting designated actors from dollar-denominated finance). U.S. Treasury's sanctions authorities are unmatched in reach and effectiveness.

**Alliance networks** amplify American economic power. U.S. treaty allies represent roughly 60% of global GDP and include the other major technology producers (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Germany, Netherlands). When the U.S. can coordinate economic statecraft with allies—as it largely succeeded in doing with semiconductor export controls and Russia sanctions—the collective economic power vastly exceeds what America could wield alone. This is China's primary structural disadvantage: it lacks comparable wealthy, technologically advanced treaty allies.

**Institutional influence** in organizations like the WTO, IMF, and World Bank provides agenda-setting power, though this has eroded as China develops alternative institutions. America's ability to shape rules for intellectual property, state subsidies, and trade disputes gives it structural advantages even when specific disputes don't go its way.

American strategic objectives have evolved from engagement to competition. Contemporary U.S. strategy, articulated across both Trump and Biden administrations, centers on **maintaining technological leadership** in domains critical for economic competitiveness and military effectiveness (semiconductors, AI, quantum, biotech), **preventing technological leapfrogging** by China through forced technology transfer or cyber espionage, **building resilient supply chains** that reduce dangerous dependencies on China for critical goods, and **maintaining dollar dominance** and financial system centrality that enable sanctions enforcement and intelligence gathering.

But American strategy faces distinctive constraints. **Commercial interests** often conflict with security imperatives: restricting sales to China costs American firms revenue and may shift market share to foreign competitors. **Allied coordination** is challenging when allies face different threat perceptions and commercial dependencies (European exposure to Chinese market pressure differs from American). **Domestic politics** complicate sustained strategies when constituencies bear costs (farmers hurt by Chinese retaliatory tariffs, consumers facing higher prices from tariffs and supply chain restrictions). **Institutional limitations** constrain executive authority: export controls must demonstrate national security rationale, tariffs face WTO constraints, and financial sanctions can be challenged in courts.

The resulting U.S. approach is asymmetric restriction: comprehensive controls on chokepoint technologies critical for advanced computing and AI, combined with continued economic engagement in less sensitive domains. This attempts to slow Chinese advancement in strategic technologies while avoiding complete decoupling that would impose prohibitive costs on American firms and consumers.

### 3.4 The Logic of Economic Competition

The US-China economic competition differs from Cold War precedent in several crucial ways. First, it occurs within deep interdependence rather than separate economic blocs. This creates mutual vulnerabilities and domestic constituencies opposing decoupling. Second, it centers on technology and innovation rather than ideology. The competition is about who masters AI, quantum computing, and biotechnology—domains with both commercial and military applications. Third, it involves a broader toolkit than traditional sanctions. Export controls, investment screening, standard-setting, talent restrictions, development finance, and regulatory investigations all serve strategic purposes.

The competition is likely to persist regardless of which parties govern in Washington or Beijing. Structural factors—China's determination to achieve technology self-sufficiency, American concerns about dependence on a strategic competitor, the dual-use nature of emerging technologies—create enduring drivers for economic statecraft. How the two powers manage this competition while maintaining sufficient cooperation in areas of shared interest (climate change, pandemic response, financial stability) is the central challenge of contemporary international relations.

The next sections examine how analysts can systematically assess economic coercion efforts in this context, what tools governments employ, and how different perspectives shape strategic choices.

## Perspective Box: Chinese Views on Economic Statecraft

Effective strategy requires understanding how adversaries perceive threats, opportunities, and constraints. This perspective box presents Chinese viewpoints on economic statecraft—not to endorse them, but to explain how historical experience and strategic culture shape Beijing's approach to economic coercion. Understanding this logic is essential for anticipating Chinese responses and designing effective policies.

### Historical Context: Three Formative Experiences

Chinese perspectives on economic statecraft are inseparable from three historical experiences that shape elite and popular consciousness.

**The Century of Humiliation (百年国耻, bǎinián guóchǐ, 1839-1949).** From the First Opium War through Japanese occupation and civil war, China experienced foreign invasion, unequal treaties, territorial losses, and economic exploitation. Western powers and Japan used superior military and economic power to extract concessions, impose trade terms favorable to foreign interests, and carve China into spheres of influence. The Opium Wars specifically involved Britain using military force to compel China to accept opium imports—weaponized trade in its most literal form.

This period is not ancient history in Chinese political discourse. It is actively invoked to explain why sovereignty and non-interference are paramount, why China must never again be weak enough to be exploited, and why foreign pressure—even through ostensibly "economic" means—represents attempted domination. When American officials frame export controls as defensive measures to protect national security, many Chinese hear echoes of 19th-century justifications for imposing unequal terms on a weaker China.

**Cold War Isolation and Technology Denial (1949-1979).** After the Communist victory in 1949, Western powers—led by the United States—imposed comprehensive economic restrictions and technology denial on the People's Republic. China was excluded from the Bretton Woods institutions (IMF, World Bank), faced embargoes on strategic goods through CoCom and the China Committee (CHINCOM), and had minimal access to Western technology and capital. The Soviet Union provided some technology and assistance until the Sino-Soviet split in 1960, after which China faced isolation from both major blocs.

This experience taught that adversaries will use technology denial to constrain China's development, that self-reliance (自力更生, zìlì gēngshēng) is necessary because external supply cannot be trusted, and that breaking through such containment requires sustained effort and sacrifice. China's development of nuclear weapons despite isolation—the "Two Bombs, One Satellite" (两弹一星, liǎng dàn yī xīng) program—is celebrated as proving that determined effort can overcome foreign restrictions.

**The Reform Era's Double-Bind (1979-Present).** Deng Xiaoping's opening brought access to Western capital, technology, and markets—enabling extraordinary growth. But it also created new dependencies and vulnerabilities. China became reliant on imported semiconductors, advanced machinery, and critical technologies. Economic integration created leverage that trading partners could exploit: Japan's 2010 rare earth restrictions following the fishing captain incident, the EU's anti-dumping actions, and more recently American semiconductor controls all demonstrated that economic partners could become economic coercers when interests diverged.

This experience reinforces that integration brings growth but also vulnerability, that dependence on foreign technology in strategic domains is dangerous, and that China must achieve self-sufficiency in critical technologies to ensure sovereignty. The current drive for semiconductor independence reflects lessons learned from this period: economic interdependence does not guarantee benign treatment.

### Strategic Logic and Threat Perception

From these experiences, Chinese strategists derive several core propositions about economic statecraft that differ from Western liberal assumptions.

**Economic coercion is a tool of the strong against the weak.** In the Chinese reading of history, economic statecraft has primarily been used by powerful states to dominate weaker ones: Opium Wars, unequal treaties, CoCom/CHINCOM, contemporary sanctions on countries that cannot effectively resist. The liberal narrative that sanctions promote human rights or enforce international norms is viewed skeptically as post-hoc rationalization for coercion that serves the interests of sanctioning powers. When the United States imposes sanctions on China, many Chinese analysts see not protection of liberal values but attempted constraint of a rising power by an incumbent seeking to maintain dominance.

**Technology denial aims to maintain hierarchy.** Chinese analysts view Western technology restrictions—from CoCom to contemporary semiconductor controls—as efforts to preserve technological superiority and economic hierarchy, not primarily as defensive national security measures. The logic is straightforward: if China achieves parity in advanced semiconductors, AI, and other strategic technologies, American military and economic advantages erode. Export controls are therefore seen as offensive measures to maintain U.S. primacy, not defensive actions to protect against Chinese aggression. This framing makes compliance appear as acceptance of permanent subordination—politically impossible for a rising power with China's history and aspirations.

**Self-reliance is both necessity and virtue.** Given that foreign suppliers cannot be trusted (they impose restrictions when strategic interests dictate), China must achieve self-sufficiency in critical technologies and resources. This is framed not merely as strategic necessity but as moral imperative: self-reliance (自力更生) means refusing to accept dependence and vulnerability. Massive investments in domestic semiconductor capacity, rare earth processing, and alternative payment systems reflect this logic. The economic inefficiency of duplicating capacity is accepted as the price of sovereignty.

**Reciprocity and retaliation are legitimate.** If other countries use economic measures coercively against China, Beijing has both right and obligation to respond in kind. China's Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law (2021) explicitly authorizes countermeasures against entities implementing foreign sanctions. Export controls on gallium and germanium following U.S. semiconductor restrictions are framed as appropriate reciprocity, not aggressive escalation. The unstated logic is that only by demonstrating capacity and willingness to impose costs can China deter further restrictions—appeasement invites greater pressure.

### Official Position and Policy Responses

Chinese official discourse emphasizes several themes that justify economic statecraft while criticizing its use by others.

**Non-interference and sovereignty.** Official statements consistently invoke the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and respect for sovereignty. Economic coercion that aims to change target countries' domestic policies (human rights sanctions, democracy promotion) is condemned as violation of sovereignty. At the same time, China reserves the right to use economic measures to protect core interests—the distinction being that China's actions defend sovereignty while Western sanctions violate it.

**Mutual benefit and win-win cooperation (互利共赢, hùlì gòngyíng).** China frames its economic statecraft—Belt and Road financing, technology cooperation, trade relationships—as promoting mutual benefit, contrasting with zero-sum Western approaches. This narrative positions China as offering development opportunities while the West imposes restrictions and conditions. The reality is more complex (BRI projects involve strategic calculations and create dependencies), but the framing serves political purposes domestically and internationally.

**Opposition to hegemonism and bullying.** Chinese leaders consistently criticize what they term "hegemonism" (霸权主义, bàquán zhǔyì) and "economic bullying" (经济霸凌, jīngjì bàlíng)—using economic dominance to coerce others. U.S. sanctions and export controls are prime examples in this discourse. Xi Jinping's speeches regularly warn against "unilateralism and protectionism" and advocate for "true multilateralism" that respects all countries' interests, positioning China as defender of smaller states against superpower coercion.

**Key policy responses** reflect these strategic perspectives:

- **Dual Circulation Strategy (双循环, shuāng xúnhuán):** Emphasizes domestic consumption and innovation to reduce dependence on foreign markets and technology while maintaining international economic engagement. Internal circulation (domestic) provides resilience; external circulation (international) provides growth and resources.

- **Technology Self-Sufficiency (科技自立自强, kējì zìlì zìqiáng):** Massive state investment in semiconductors, advanced materials, aerospace, AI, and other strategic technologies to eliminate chokepoint vulnerabilities. The "Big Fund" for semiconductors exceeds $100 billion in capital commitments.

- **Unreliable Entity List (不可靠实体清单, bù kěkào shítǐ qīngdān):** Mechanism to sanction foreign entities that damage Chinese firms' interests, refuse to supply based on political grounds, or implement discriminatory restrictions. Provides tool for retaliation and deterrence.

- **Export Control Law (2020):** Establishes legal framework for controlling exports of dual-use items, critical technologies, and other goods for national security. Enables reciprocal restrictions when China holds chokepoint leverage (rare earths, critical minerals, pharmaceutical ingredients).

- **Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law (2021):** Authorizes countermeasures against entities and individuals implementing foreign sanctions, including blocking property, prohibiting transactions, and denying visas. Creates legal basis for economic retaliation.

### Key Chinese Strategic Concepts

Several concepts that do not translate directly into English are central to Chinese strategic thinking on economic statecraft.

**Comprehensive National Power (综合国力, zōnghé guólì).** This concept integrates economic capacity, technological sophistication, military strength, cultural influence, and political cohesion into a holistic measure of national power. Economic statecraft serves the goal of increasing comprehensive national power—not just GDP growth, but technological autonomy, resource security, and systemic influence. This explains why China accepts economic inefficiency (overcapacity in strategic industries, duplication of semiconductor capacity) in service of strategic objectives: comprehensive national power includes the capacity to withstand pressure and project influence, not just maximize economic output.

**Chokepoint (卡脖子, qiǎ bózi, literally "strangling the neck").** This vivid term describes critical dependencies on foreign technology or resources that adversaries can exploit. Semiconductors are the archetypal "chokepoint" technology—China imports over $400 billion in chips annually and cannot produce cutting-edge chips domestically. Eliminating chokepoints through indigenous innovation is a central strategic priority. The term's visceral imagery—being strangled—conveys the perceived threat from technological dependence.

**Unreliable Entities (不可靠实体, bù kěkào shítǐ).** Foreign firms or governments that weaponize economic relationships, refuse to supply goods for political reasons, or discriminate against Chinese entities. The concept justifies retaliation: if you prove "unreliable" by politicizing economic ties, China will exclude you from its market or restrict your access to critical Chinese-supplied inputs.

**Core Interests (核心利益, héxīn lìyì).** Issues on which China will not compromise and will use all available tools—including economic coercion—to defend. Traditionally includes sovereignty over Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang, as well as the Communist Party's political monopoly. Increasingly extends to technology autonomy and freedom from external constraints on development. Signals to adversaries which issues might trigger serious escalation.

### Implications for US/Western Strategy

Understanding Chinese perspectives does not mean accepting their validity, but it does inform more effective policy.

**Export controls are seen as containment.** However U.S. policymakers frame semiconductor restrictions, Beijing interprets them as strategic containment similar to CoCom—efforts to maintain American technological superiority and prevent China from achieving great power status. This means compliance is unlikely; instead, expect massive Chinese investment in overcoming restrictions through indigenous innovation, however economically inefficient.

**Economic dependencies cut both ways.** China increasingly recognizes its own chokepoint leverage in rare earths, battery materials, pharmaceutical ingredients, and manufacturing capacity for critical goods. Expect Beijing to develop these capabilities systematically, both as deterrent against Western restrictions and as potential coercive tools. The gallium/germanium export controls following U.S. semiconductor measures preview this approach.

**Retaliation is predictable and intentional.** Chinese countermeasures to economic coercion serve multiple purposes: imposing costs to deter future restrictions, signaling resolve, demonstrating to domestic audiences that China does not accept pressure passively, and testing adversaries' pain tolerance. Policymakers should anticipate proportional retaliation and plan accordingly.

**Off-ramps require face-saving.** Chinese political culture places high value on avoiding public humiliation. Economic coercion that appears designed to force China into embarrassing concessions or public backdowns is likely to fail regardless of economic costs. Effective inducements provide ways to change policy while maintaining dignity—framing as mutual adjustment rather than unilateral surrender.

**Long time horizons shape Chinese strategy.** China plans in decades, not electoral cycles. Short-term economic pain from restrictions is acceptable if long-term trajectory points toward technology autonomy and great power status. Western policymakers often expect economic costs to produce rapid policy changes; Chinese planning horizons make this less likely.

Recognizing these perspectives does not mean validating Chinese historical narratives or accepting Chinese positions on Taiwan, human rights, or economic practices. It means understanding the strategic logic that shapes Beijing's responses to economic statecraft—logic rooted in historical experience, articulated through specific concepts, and embedded in institutional frameworks. Effective policy must account for this logic rather than assuming Chinese decision-makers share Western liberal assumptions about interdependence, norms, and the purposes of economic engagement.
