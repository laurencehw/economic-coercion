# Critical Sectors and Strategic Resources

## Executive Summary

On February 24, 2022, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, launching the largest European land war since 1945. Within days, Western nations responded with unprecedented economic sanctions: asset freezes, SWIFT exclusions, export controls, and restrictions on Russian energy imports. Yet Europe faced a stark vulnerability: decades of policy had created profound dependence on Russian natural gas. Germany imported 55% of its gas from Russia, Italy 40%, and numerous Eastern European countries approached 100%. Russia's Gazprom had become Europe's largest gas supplier, with pipelines threading across the continent and the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline ready to double capacity. This dependence meant that Europe's most powerful economic weapon—energy sanctions—would inflict severe pain on European consumers and industries while funding the very Russian war machine it opposed.

The crisis crystallized a fundamental reality of contemporary geopolitics: control over critical resources—energy, food, water, strategic minerals—confers coercive leverage that rivals military power. Europe's gas dependence was not accidental but the product of deliberate choices: Russian gas was cheap, pipelines were efficient, and economic interdependence was assumed to promote peace. As winter 2022 approached and Russian gas supplies dwindled (whether from Russian restrictions or European substitution efforts), German factories faced production cuts, British households saw energy bills triple, and European governments scrambled to secure alternative supplies—liquefied natural gas from the United States and Qatar, coal from Australia, nuclear power restarts, and crash programs in renewables and efficiency.

The Russia-Ukraine crisis demonstrated that resource dependencies create strategic vulnerabilities in ways that manufacturing supply chains alone cannot capture. Food, energy, and water are existential needs—societies cannot function without them. Unlike semiconductors or rare earth magnets, which can be stockpiled or substituted over months or years, energy shortages cause immediate economic damage and political crisis. Heat goes off, factories close, transportation systems fail, and governments fall. This makes energy dependencies particularly attractive targets for economic coercion and particularly difficult dependencies to escape.

This chapter examines three critical resource sectors where dependencies create strategic vulnerabilities: food security, energy systems, and strategic resources including water and minerals essential for national survival. Three core arguments organize the analysis.

First, **resource dependencies differ from manufacturing supply chains in their immediacy and essentiality**. Semiconductor shortages are painful and economically costly, but they unfold over quarters as inventory depletes and production backlogs grow. Energy and food shortages trigger immediate crises—cold homes, dark streets, empty shelves—that generate intense political pressure within days or weeks. This immediacy makes resource coercion particularly potent: the target cannot easily wait out restrictions or slowly build alternatives. It also makes resource dependencies politically salient in ways that technical supply chains often are not—voters understand energy prices and food availability far more viscerally than chip fabrication processes.

Second, **geographic concentration of resource production creates chokepoints that can be weaponized through export restrictions, transit disruptions, or infrastructure control**. Russia supplies roughly 40% of European gas imports and 30% of oil (pre-2022 figures). The Strait of Hormuz handles 21% of global oil trade—Iran or others could potentially disrupt this flow. Ukraine and Russia together export 30% of global wheat, with many Middle Eastern and African nations dependent on Black Sea grain. China controls 60% of rare earth processing and 80% of solar panel manufacturing. These concentrations mean that disrupting a single country's exports or a single transit route can trigger global shortages and price spikes.

Third, **resource nationalism and export restrictions are proliferating as countries recognize that resource leverage confers strategic advantages**. Indonesia banned nickel ore exports in 2020 to force development of domestic smelting. Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile (the "lithium triangle") are debating restrictions to capture more battery value chains domestically. Russia has repeatedly used energy cutoffs as political leverage against Ukraine, Belarus, and others. China restricted rare earth exports in 2010 and critical minerals (gallium, germanium, graphite) in 2023. Countries increasingly view resources not as commodities to trade freely but as strategic assets to husband and leverage.

The chapter proceeds in four main sections. Section 1 examines **food security and agricultural dependencies**, analyzing how concentration in grain exports, fertilizer production, and agricultural inputs creates vulnerabilities—particularly for Middle Eastern and African nations dependent on wheat imports. Section 2 explores **energy security**, tracing the geopolitics of oil, natural gas, and coal while examining how the energy transition creates new dependencies on minerals and manufacturing. Section 3 analyzes **strategic resources beyond energy and food**—including water, phosphates for fertilizer, and other inputs essential for national survival—examining how scarcity and uneven distribution create coercive leverage. Section 4 evaluates **resource nationalism and export restrictions**, documenting the proliferation of policies that restrict resource exports to pursue strategic objectives.

The chapter includes two major case studies applying the analytical framework from Chapter 1. Case Study 1 examines **European dependence on Russian gas**, tracing how the relationship developed from the 1970s through the 2022 crisis, analyzing why Europe built such deep dependencies despite security warnings, and evaluating the painful adjustment process when geopolitics forced diversification. Case Study 2 revisits the **2010 China rare earth export restrictions** (introduced briefly in Chapter 2), providing detailed analysis of China's motivations, Japan's responses, and the broader implications for resource leverage in U.S.-China competition.

Two Government Tools Boxes explain mechanisms states use to address resource vulnerabilities. The first covers the **Defense Production Act's Title III authority**, which funds expansion of domestic production capacity for critical materials. The second examines **strategic stockpiles**—the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, National Defense Stockpile, and similar programs that buffer supply disruptions through reserves.

A Chinese Perspective Box explores Beijing's views on resource security, shaped by historical experiences of blockade and embargo. Key concepts include **resource security** (资源安全, zīyuán ānquán), **energy independence** (能源独立, néngyuán dúlì), and **food self-sufficiency** (粮食自给, liángshí zìjǐ). The box examines China's strategies to secure resource access through the Belt and Road Initiative, investments in foreign mining and energy assets, development of strategic reserves, and pursuit of technological alternatives (renewable energy, synthetic biology).

The stakes are profound. Resource control has shaped geopolitics throughout history—from British control over Indian cotton and opium, to Cold War competition over Middle Eastern oil, to contemporary struggles over lithium and rare earths. As climate change stresses water and food systems, as energy transitions reshape dependencies, and as resource nationalism proliferates, understanding resource leverage becomes essential for both national strategy and business planning. The food and energy crises of 2022-2023 demonstrated that resource security is not an abstract concern but an immediate driver of inflation, political instability, and geopolitical realignment. How states manage resource dependencies—and resource leverage—will profoundly shape the 21st century international order.

## Food Security and Agricultural Dependencies

### The Centrality of Food to National Security

Food occupies a unique position in the hierarchy of strategic resources. Unlike semiconductors, rare earths, or even energy, food is a daily necessity without substitutes or alternatives. A country can survive semiconductor shortages, painful though they may be economically. It can ration energy, switching from gas to coal or implementing conservation. But it cannot substitute for food—people must eat, and societies where people cannot eat collapse into chaos, mass migration, or revolution. This existential quality makes food security central to regime stability and makes food leverage particularly potent in coercive strategies.

Historical examples demonstrate food's strategic power. Stalin's forced collectivization and grain requisitions in Ukraine during 1932-1933 (the Holodomor) killed millions and crushed Ukrainian resistance to Soviet rule—food as a weapon of internal control. Britain's World War I naval blockade starved Germany into submission, with German civilian deaths from malnutrition and disease exceeding combat casualties—food as a siege weapon. The 1970s U.S. grain embargo against the Soviet Union following Afghanistan's invasion aimed to economically pressure Moscow, though its effectiveness was limited by alternative suppliers and Soviet domestic production increases—food as a sanction tool. More recently, Saudi Arabia and UAE used food dependencies as leverage during the 2017-2021 Qatar crisis, and China informally restricted agricultural imports from Australia during 2020-2021 trade tensions.

Contemporary food systems have globalized dramatically since the 1970s, with international agricultural trade growing faster than agricultural production. This globalization reflects comparative advantage—Argentina grows soybeans efficiently, Thailand specializes in rice, United States and Brazil dominate corn and wheat, New Zealand exports dairy. The result is that roughly 20% of global food calories cross borders, and for specific commodities (wheat, soybeans, rice) trade shares reach 25-40%. Many countries, particularly in the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Asia, have become structurally import-dependent—they cannot feed their populations from domestic production alone.

This import dependence creates strategic vulnerabilities when suppliers restrict exports, prices spike, or logistics disruptions constrain supply. The 2007-2008 global food crisis demonstrated these dynamics: rising grain prices triggered export restrictions by major suppliers (India, Vietnam, Russia, Argentina), exacerbating shortages and causing riots in Egypt, Haiti, and numerous other countries. The Arab Spring uprisings of 2011 followed wheat price spikes partly attributable to Russian export bans after drought. The COVID-19 pandemic saw multiple countries impose agricultural export restrictions, raising fears of cascading protectionism. And Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, both major wheat exporters, triggered global grain shortages that pushed Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia, and other import-dependent nations toward economic crisis.

### Grain Trade Chokepoints and Export Concentration

Global grain trade exhibits concentration that creates strategic chokepoints. Wheat, the most globally traded staple crop, comes overwhelmingly from a handful of exporters. Russia and Ukraine together account for approximately 30% of global wheat exports, supplying Egypt (the world's largest wheat importer, sourcing 80%+ from the Black Sea region), Turkey, Lebanon, Libya, Yemen, Bangladesh, and numerous others. The United States exports roughly 15% of global wheat, primarily to Japan, Philippines, Mexico, and Central American nations. Canada, France, Australia, and Argentina round out the top exporters—six countries control roughly 70-75% of global wheat trade.

Corn (maize) is even more concentrated. The United States produces approximately 35% of global corn and dominates exports with 30-35% market share, supplying Mexico, Japan, South Korea, and others. Brazil has emerged as the second-largest exporter (20-25% share), with Argentina third (15-20%). These three countries control 65-75% of global corn trade—a concentration that reflects the crop's specific climatic requirements, the capital intensity of modern industrial corn farming, and economies of scale in logistics and processing.

Rice trade, while smaller in volume than wheat or corn, exhibits similar concentration. India and Thailand together account for 45-50% of global rice exports, with Vietnam, Pakistan, and the United States comprising the next tier. Several Southeast Asian nations depend on these exports for food security, and any disruption—such as India's periodic export bans to control domestic prices—creates immediate shortages for importers.

Soybeans, critical for animal feed and increasingly for human consumption, come primarily from the United States (35-40% of exports), Brazil (45-50%), and Argentina (5-10%). China imports approximately 60% of globally traded soybeans, making it uniquely dependent on Western Hemisphere production. This dependence factored significantly in U.S.-China trade negotiations, with Trump administration officials recognizing that threatening soybean sales could pressure Beijing—though China's ability to source from Brazil limited U.S. leverage and ultimately Argentina and Brazilian suppliers gained market share.

This export concentration creates several vulnerabilities. First, **weather and crop failures in major exporters trigger global shortages**. Russia's 2010 drought and subsequent export ban caused wheat prices to spike 50%, contributing to the Arab Spring unrest. U.S. droughts in 2012 pushed corn prices to record highs, straining livestock producers globally and increasing food costs for consumers. As climate change increases weather variability and extreme events become more frequent, these supply shocks will likely intensify.

Second, **geopolitical crises disrupting major exporters cascade globally**. Russia's invasion of Ukraine immediately threatened 30% of global wheat exports, with Black Sea ports blockaded, Ukrainian fields becoming battlegrounds, and Russian exports restricted by sanctions or deliberate cutoffs. Egypt, importing 80%+ of wheat from this region, faced immediate shortages and bread subsidy costs that strained government budgets. Lebanon, already in economic collapse, saw food prices surge. Tunisia, Morocco, and other North African nations scrambled for alternative supplies at higher prices. The crisis demonstrated how geopolitical conflicts in agricultural exporters translate directly into food security threats for importers thousands of miles away.

Third, **export restrictions by major suppliers can weaponize dependencies**. During shortages or crises, grain exporters frequently restrict exports to secure domestic supply and control prices—rational from the exporter's perspective but devastating for importers. The 2007-2008 food crisis saw 20+ countries impose agricultural export restrictions. Russia banned wheat exports in 2010-2011 following drought. India periodically restricts rice and wheat exports when domestic prices rise. These restrictions, often implemented suddenly and without warning, leave importers unable to secure supply at any price, triggering panic buying, hoarding, and political instability.

### Food Import Dependencies: Middle East and North Africa

Certain regions exhibit structural import dependence and limited arable land constrained by the Nile River and deserts, imports approximately 60-70% of wheat consumption and is the world's largest wheat importer by volume. Subsidized bread (baladi) is central to Egyptian social stability—previous attempts to reduce bread subsidies triggered riots, and the government spends $2-3 billion annually subsidizing bread. During the 2007-2008 food crisis, wheat prices spiked, subsidy costs ballooned, and bread shortages sparked protests that foreshadowed the 2011 Arab Spring. The 2022 Ukraine crisis again threatened wheat supply, forcing Egypt to negotiate desperately for alternative sources from India, Australia, and others—at higher prices that strained foreign reserves and government budgets.

Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, oil-rich but agriculturally constrained by desert climates, import 80-90% of food. Both countries attempted agricultural self-sufficiency in the 1980s-1990s, growing wheat in the desert through massive irrigation drawing down fossil aquifers. The policies proved economically and environmentally unsustainable (Saudi Arabia was depleting aquifers at rates that would exhaust them within decades), and both shifted strategies toward securing food through imports and foreign agricultural investments. Saudi Arabia and UAE now invest heavily in African and Asian agricultural land, ensuring access to foreign production—a modern form of resource imperialism that grants leverage without formal control.

Yemen, embroiled in civil war since 2015, imports approximately 90% of food. The Saudi-led coalition's blockade of Yemeni ports has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the population requiring humanitarian aid and millions facing famine. Food access becomes a weapon in civil conflict—controlling ports and supply routes means controlling populations.

Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Jordan, and Lebanon similarly import 50-80% of grains. Libya's 2011 civil war disrupted food distribution systems despite the country's oil wealth. Tunisia's 2011 uprising partly reflected bread price increases. Jordan faces refugee influxes from Syria and Palestine that strain food systems. Lebanon's 2019-2021 economic collapse saw bread subsidies eliminated, triggering shortages and rationing.

This pervasive import dependence creates several dynamics. First, **food price volatility translates directly into political instability**. When bread prices double or triple, regimes lacking legitimacy face protests, riots, and potential overthrow. The correlation between wheat price spikes and Arab Spring uprisings is well documented—while not deterministic (many factors drove uprisings), food insecurity provided tinder for political fires.

Second, **exporters can leverage food dependencies for political concessions or strategic alignment**. Russia has explicitly used grain diplomacy, offering discounts or prioritizing supplies to friendly nations while restricting shipments to others. China has informally restricted agricultural imports from Australia (barley, wine, beef, lobster) as retaliation for Australian foreign policy positions, demonstrating willingness to weaponize market access. The United States historically used food aid and grain sales as foreign policy tools, with P.L. 480 food aid programs supporting aligned regimes during the Cold War.

Third, **food import dependence constrains foreign policy autonomy**. Countries dependent on food imports cannot easily antagonize major exporters, limiting diplomatic flexibility. This creates leverage for exporters: Russia's provision of wheat to Middle Eastern and African nations generates political goodwill and constrains criticism of Russian actions in Ukraine or elsewhere. China's growing role as agricultural exporter and investor gives Beijing influence in countries traditionally aligned with the West.

### Fertilizers, Agricultural Inputs, and Supply Chain Dependencies

Food security depends not only on finished grain but also on agricultural inputs—fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, machinery—without which production collapses. These inputs exhibit their own concentration and dependencies that create supply chain vulnerabilities.

**Fertilizers** represent the most critical agricultural input. Modern high-yield agriculture depends on nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium (NPK) fertilizers that dramatically increase crop yields—removing fertilizers would reduce global agricultural production by an estimated 40-50%, causing mass famine. Yet fertilizer production and export are highly concentrated geographically.

Nitrogen fertilizers, primarily ammonia and urea, require natural gas as feedstock (the Haber-Bosch process converts atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia using hydrogen derived from methane). Russia, with abundant natural gas, produces roughly 15% of global nitrogen fertilizers and exports 20% of ammonia and 13% of urea. China produces 28% of nitrogen fertilizers, primarily for domestic use. Europe, dependent on natural gas for fertilizer production, saw fertilizer plants shut down in 2022 when gas prices spiked following Russia's Ukraine invasion—reduced fertilizer production threatened European and global agricultural output.

Phosphate fertilizers depend on phosphate rock, mined in limited locations. Morocco controls approximately 70% of global phosphate rock reserves and is the leading exporter. China produces 40% of phosphate fertilizers (mostly for domestic use), with United States, Morocco, and Russia as other major producers. This concentration means that disruptions to Moroccan production or Chinese export policies can create global fertilizer shortages.

Potassium (potash) fertilizers come overwhelmingly from Canada (30% of global production), Russia (20%), and Belarus (17%). Combined, these three countries control two-thirds of global potash supply. Russia and Belarus's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine triggered Western sanctions that disrupted potash exports, contributing to fertilizer shortages and price spikes that threatened global agricultural production.

The 2021-2022 fertilizer crisis demonstrated these dependencies vividly. Natural gas price spikes (driven partly by reduced Russian supplies to Europe) made nitrogen fertilizer production uneconomical in Europe, forcing plant closures. Sanctions on Russian and Belarusian potash restricted supply. Phosphate prices surged due to increased demand and logistical constraints. The combined fertilizer shock pushed costs up 100-200%, threatening farmers' ability to afford inputs and raising prospects of reduced plantings and lower yields globally. Developing countries, where farmers have less capital to absorb price increases, faced particularly acute risks of food production declines.

**Pesticides and herbicides** similarly concentrate in a handful of companies—Bayer (post-Monsanto acquisition), Corteva, BASF, and Syngenta (Chinese-owned) control approximately 70% of the global agrochemical market. Most active ingredients are manufactured in China or India, with formulation and distribution by these major firms. Supply chain disruptions, regulatory restrictions, or deliberate export controls could constrain pesticide availability, threatening crop protection and yields.

**Seeds** for major crops are dominated by a few multinational firms. Bayer-Monsanto, Corteva, Syngenta, and BASF control roughly 60% of the global seed market. For genetically modified (GM) crops—common in soybeans, corn, and cotton—farmers depend on seeds from these companies, with intellectual property restrictions preventing seed saving and replanting. This creates dependence on seed suppliers' continued provision and raises food security concerns if geopolitical conflicts disrupt access.

**Agricultural machinery**—tractors, combines, irrigation equipment—comes primarily from companies in the United States (John Deere, CNH Industrial), Europe (AGCO), Japan (Kubota), and increasingly China. Modern precision agriculture depends on GPS guidance, automated systems, and digital farm management—technologies controlled by these manufacturers. Russia's ability to maintain agricultural machinery has been constrained by Western sanctions cutting off parts and expertise, illustrating how supply chain dependencies extend even to agricultural equipment.

The broader lesson is that **food security depends on complex supply chains extending far beyond farmland and grain elevators**. Disrupting fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, or machinery can reduce agricultural production as effectively as restricting grain exports directly. Countries pursuing food self-sufficiency must consider not just land and water but also inputs that often depend on foreign suppliers—a challenge that makes true food independence extraordinarily difficult for all but the most resource-rich nations.

## Energy Security - Oil, Gas, and the Geopolitics of Transition

### Energy as the Lifeblood of Modern Economies

If food is essential for human survival, energy is essential for economic activity. Modern economies run on energy: electricity powers factories, data centers, hospitals, and homes; transportation depends on liquid fuels for cars, trucks, ships, and planes; heating and cooling require gas, electricity, or oil; and industrial processes from steel to chemicals to cement are energy-intensive. Unlike food, where substitution is impossible, energy offers some fuel-switching flexibility (coal to gas, oil to electricity, nuclear to renewables). But this flexibility is limited, expensive, and time-consuming—switching requires building new infrastructure, and some applications (aviation, heavy trucking, steel) currently lack economically viable alternatives to fossil fuels.

Energy dependence has shaped geopolitics for over a century. World War I and II both involved critical struggles for oil access—Japanese expansion into Southeast Asia targeted oil fields, German campaigns in North Africa and the Caucasus sought petroleum. The Cold War saw repeated Middle Eastern conflicts driven partly by oil: the 1956 Suez Crisis, 1973 Arab oil embargo, 1979 Iranian Revolution, and 1990 Gulf War all reflected oil's strategic significance. American foreign policy in the Middle East for decades centered on securing reliable oil flows to the West, protecting Saudi Arabia and Gulf states, and preventing hostile powers from controlling oil chokepoints.

Today's energy geopolitics remains dominated by oil and gas but is complicated by two dynamics: the shale revolution that transformed the United States from major importer to net exporter, and the energy transition toward renewables that creates new dependencies while potentially reducing fossil fuel leverage. Understanding contemporary energy security requires examining both traditional fossil fuel dependencies and emerging vulnerabilities in the transition to low-carbon energy.

### Oil: Declining but Still Dominant

Petroleum remains the world's largest energy source, accounting for roughly 30-32% of primary energy consumption and dominating transportation with 90%+ market share. Global oil production reaches approximately 100 million barrels per day (mb/d), with supply distributed across multiple regions but exhibiting significant concentration among major producers.

The United States, transformed by shale oil development, is now the world's largest producer at 18-20 mb/d, overtaking Saudi Arabia (11-12 mb/d) and Russia (10-11 mb/d). These three countries alone produce 40% of global oil. The next tier includes Canada (5-6 mb/d, primarily from oil sands), Iraq (4-5 mb/d), China (4 mb/d, though mostly consumed domestically), UAE (4 mb/d), Iran (3-4 mb/d when not sanctioned), Brazil, Kuwait, and others. Fifteen countries produce roughly 75-80% of global oil, indicating substantial but not extreme concentration.

What creates strategic leverage is not production per se but **exportable surplus**—production minus domestic consumption. Many large producers consume most output domestically (United States, China, Brazil) and thus export little. Net exporters control global supply. Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Canada, and Norway dominate oil exports. Saudi Arabia's position as swing producer—able to increase or decrease production by millions of barrels daily—grants unique influence over global prices. Russia's exports, particularly to Europe and China, represent 10-12% of global supply, giving Moscow geopolitical leverage.

Oil trade flows reveal critical dependencies. Europe imports approximately 90% of oil consumption, primarily from Russia (pre-2022: 25-30% of EU oil imports), Middle Eastern producers (40%), and Norway/North Africa (30%). Asia is the world's largest oil-consuming region, with China, Japan, South Korea, and India together importing 20-25 mb/d. China alone imports 10-11 mb/d (70% of consumption), sourced from the Middle East (50%), Russia (15%), Africa (12%), and Latin America. Japan and South Korea import 95%+ of oil needs. These dependencies create strategic vulnerabilities—any disruption to Middle Eastern supply or key shipping routes threatens energy security.

**Maritime chokepoints** amplify vulnerability. Most oil trade occurs via tanker through a handful of narrow straits that could be blockaded or disrupted.

- **Strait of Hormuz** (between Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman): Approximately 21% of global oil consumption transits this 21-mile-wide passage. Closure would immediately remove 21 million barrels per day from global markets, more than doubling oil prices and potentially triggering global recession. Iran has repeatedly threatened closure if attacked, demonstrating the strait's strategic leverage. U.S. military presence in the Gulf aims partly to secure this chokepoint against Iranian action.

- **Strait of Malacca** (between Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore): Approximately 16 mb/d transits this strait, primarily supplying East Asian consumers (China, Japan, South Korea). While alternative routes exist (Sunda Strait, Lombok Strait), they add days to transit and lack the infrastructure and depth for largest tankers. China's growing navy and "String of Pearls" strategy of ports along the Indian Ocean reflect partly concern about dependence on this chokepoint—American or Indian naval power could potentially disrupt Chinese oil imports in conflict scenarios.

- **Bab el-Mandeb Strait** (between Red Sea and Gulf of Aden): Roughly 6-7 mb/d transit this strait, primarily oil destined for Europe via Suez Canal. Yemen's civil war has seen Houthi attacks on shipping, and Iran's influence over Houthis creates potential leverage over this route. The strait is narrow enough that closure would force tankers around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, adding weeks and enormous costs.

- **Suez Canal**: Approximately 5-6 mb/d pass through the canal, linking Middle Eastern and Russian oil to Europe. The 2021 Ever Given grounding, which blocked the canal for six days, demonstrated vulnerability—though the incident affected container shipping more than oil, it illustrated how single-vessel accidents can disrupt critical trade routes. Egypt's control of the canal grants leverage and generates $6-7 billion annually in transit fees that are critical to Egyptian finances.

These chokepoints create strategic leverage for countries that can threaten closure (Iran over Hormuz, Yemen/Houthis over Bab el-Mandeb) and for naval powers that can secure or blockade them (United States, potentially China or India). They also shape energy policy: Japan's almost total dependence on oil transiting Malacca drives Japanese interest in Middle Eastern stability and U.S.-Japan security cooperation. China's anxiety about "Malacca Dilemma" motivates land-based alternatives (pipelines from Russia and Central Asia), naval expansion to protect sea lanes, and strategic petroleum reserves to buffer disruptions.

### Natural Gas: The Russia-Europe Entanglement

Natural gas differs from oil in ways that amplify dependencies and geopolitical leverage. Gas is more difficult to transport than oil: pipelines are capital-intensive infrastructure that lock in supplier-consumer relationships for decades, and liquefied natural gas (LNG)—the alternative to pipelines—requires expensive liquefaction facilities, specialized LNG tankers, and regasification terminals. These constraints mean gas markets are regionally segmented (Europe, Asia, North America operate as distinct markets with limited integration), and switching suppliers is far harder than for oil.

Europe's dependence on Russian gas developed over decades and became a defining vulnerability. Russia supplied approximately 40% of European Union gas imports pre-2022, with shares varying dramatically by country: Germany 55%, Italy 40%, Austria 80%, Poland 40%, Hungary 85%, Czech Republic 85%, Bulgaria 90%, Finland 100%, and numerous Eastern European nations 100%. This dependence reflected geography (Russia's vast gas reserves conveniently located near European markets), economics (Russian pipeline gas was cheaper than LNG alternatives), and policy choices (Germany's Energiewende prioritized renewables while phasing out nuclear and coal, requiring gas as "bridge fuel").

Multiple pipelines carried Russian gas to Europe:

- **Ukrainian transit routes**: Historically the largest, transiting 40-50% of Russian gas exports through Ukraine to Central/Western Europe. Ukraine earned $2-3 billion annually in transit fees. Russia repeatedly cut gas during disputes with Ukraine (2006, 2009, 2014), affecting downstream European customers and demonstrating gas's utility as coercive leverage.

- **Nord Stream 1** (completed 2011): Subsea pipeline through Baltic Sea directly from Russia to Germany, bypassing Ukraine. Capacity 55 billion cubic meters per year (bcm/year).

- **Nord Stream 2** (completed 2021, never operational): Parallel to Nord Stream 1, doubling direct Russia-Germany capacity. Completion faced intense U.S. opposition (Trump and Biden administrations) and Ukrainian/Polish objections. Germany's certification process was suspended days before Russia's 2022 Ukraine invasion, and the pipelines were mysteriously sabotaged in September 2022.

- **TurkStream** (completed 2020): Subsea pipeline through Black Sea to Turkey and onward to Southern Europe. Capacity 31.5 bcm/year.

- **Yamal-Europe pipeline**: Through Belarus and Poland to Germany. Russia reduced flows in 2021-2022 as tensions escalated.

This infrastructure created asymmetric interdependence. Europe depended on Russian gas for heating, power generation, and industrial processes (especially German chemical industry). Russia depended on European gas revenue, which accounted for $150-200 billion annually and funded roughly 30-40% of Russian federal budget. Conventional wisdom held that mutual dependence ensured supply stability—neither side could afford disruption. Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine shattered this assumption.

### The 2022 European Gas Crisis: Weaponized Dependence

Russia's February 2022 invasion triggered European economic sanctions targeting Russian energy exports. Yet Europe's gas dependence complicated sanctions: immediate cutoff would inflict severe European economic pain (estimates suggested 5-10% GDP losses if gas disappeared suddenly), empowering Moscow rather than constraining it. European strategy thus involved phased reduction: immediate ban on Russian coal (easier to replace), six-month phase-in for oil embargoes, and continued but reduced gas imports while scrambling for alternatives.

Russia countered with its own gas weapon. Beginning in mid-2022, Gazprom progressively reduced deliveries through Nord Stream 1, claiming maintenance issues that most analysts viewed as political pressure. Flows dropped from 100% capacity to 40%, to 20%, and eventually zero by August 2022. Simultaneously, Gazprom redirected gas to China and reduced European spot market sales, prioritizing long-term contract buyers who faced higher prices. The message was clear: Russia could inflict pain through gas restrictions faster than Europe could through sanctions.

European response involved multiple desperate measures:

**LNG imports surged**: Europe bought liquefied natural gas from the United States (which became Europe's largest supplier), Qatar, and other sources. U.S. LNG exports to Europe increased from ~20 bcm/year pre-war to 60+ bcm by late 2022. New floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs) were rushed to European ports, bypassing the years normally required to build regasification terminals. Qatar negotiated long-term LNG contracts with Germany and others. Asian buyers (Japan, South Korea, China) reduced LNG purchases to free supply for Europe, accepting higher domestic prices as contribution to Western unity.

**Demand reduction** targeted 15% cuts through efficiency, industrial curtailment, and behavioral change. Germany, Netherlands, and others launched public campaigns encouraging lower heating temperatures, reduced industrial energy use, and conservation. Energy-intensive industries—aluminum smelting, chemical production, fertilizer manufacturing—faced production cuts or closures as gas became unavailable or unaffordable. German industry, heavily dependent on cheap Russian gas, saw competitiveness erode.

**Alternative energy sources** filled gaps: coal power generation increased (temporarily reversing climate goals), nuclear plant closures were delayed (Germany extended remaining plants despite decade-long phase-out plans), and renewable deployment accelerated.

**Strategic reserves** were drawn down: Europe depleted gas storage to buffer winter demand, falling to 20-30% of capacity by February 2023 before refilling in summer.

**Rationing plans** were prepared: Governments developed priority schemes ensuring households and hospitals received gas before industrial users, with industry facing potential forced curtailment.

The winter of 2022-2023 was Europe's moment of maximum vulnerability. Russian gas had dropped from 40% of imports to ~10%. Mild weather, aggressive LNG buying, and demand reduction allowed Europe to avoid catastrophic shortages. But costs were severe: European household energy bills tripled, governments spent hundreds of billions subsidizing energy costs to prevent political backlash, industrial production declined, and inflation surged. The crisis demonstrated both the potency of energy coercion and the resilience of societies willing to endure costs rather than capitulate.

**Long-term restructuring** followed. Germany announced 13+ new LNG terminals and diversification of supply. Eastern European nations accelerated connections to non-Russian sources. The European Union's REPowerEU plan targeted rapid renewable deployment, efficiency improvements, and hydrogen development to eliminate Russian fossil fuel imports by 2027. Whether Europe maintains political will to sustain these investments, and whether the transition proves economically sustainable, remains uncertain. But the crisis destroyed the assumption that economic interdependence prevents weaponization—Russia demonstrated willingness to sacrifice gas revenue for geopolitical gains, and Europe learned that energy dependencies constrain foreign policy autonomy.

### Energy Transition: Trading Old Dependencies for New

![Renewable Energy Manufacturing - China's Share](figures/figure_3_6_renewable_manufacturing.png)

The global energy transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy and electrification creates new resource dependencies that may prove as consequential as oil and gas. Solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries require minerals, manufacturing, and supply chains that exhibit their own chokepoints—many concentrated in China. Escaping dependence on Middle Eastern oil risks creating dependence on Chinese critical minerals processing and clean energy manufacturing.

China dominates renewable energy manufacturing across multiple domains. Solar panels: China produces approximately 80% of global supply, controlling polysilicon production (80%), wafers (95%), cells (85%), and module assembly (75%). This vertical integration reflects decades of industrial policy, government subsidies, and willingness to operate at losses to drive Western competitors out of business. European and American solar manufacturers largely collapsed in the 2010s, unable to compete with Chinese scale and pricing.

Wind turbines: China produces roughly 60% of global wind turbines, with Goldwind, Envision, and Ming Yang among the world's largest manufacturers. While European (Vestas, Siemens Gamesa) and American (GE Renewable Energy) firms remain significant players, China's dominance is growing, particularly in offshore wind—a critical growth market.

Batteries: As detailed in Chapter 2, China controls 75% of lithium-ion battery manufacturing and dominates supply chains for anodes (85%), cathodes (70%), and battery cells (66%). CATL alone supplies batteries to Tesla, BMW, Volkswagen, and numerous others. The Inflation Reduction Act's battery manufacturing tax credits aim to build American capacity, but China's decade-long lead means U.S. production will remain a minority share for years.

This manufacturing concentration creates dependencies analogous to oil: disruptions to Chinese supply or deliberate Chinese export restrictions could constrain renewable energy deployment globally. European and American climate goals depend partly on Chinese solar panel and battery supply. If geopolitical tensions escalate and China restricts exports or prioritizes domestic supply, Western energy transitions face delays and higher costs.

The strategic implication is paradoxical: energy transitions pursued to enhance security and reduce carbon emissions may create new dependencies on China—a potential strategic competitor. This recognition drives Western industrial policy attempting to reshore clean energy manufacturing. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, European Green Deal Industrial Plan, and similar policies provide subsidies for domestic solar, wind, and battery production. Success remains uncertain: Chinese manufacturing is often 30-50% cheaper due to scale, integrated supply chains, lower labor costs, and government support. Building competitive Western industries requires sustained subsidies, acceptance of higher consumer costs, and political commitment across election cycles—all uncertain.

Moreover, energy transitions depend on minerals examined in Chapter 2—lithium, cobalt, nickel, rare earths—where China's processing dominance creates additional chokepoints. The full supply chain from lithium mine to finished EV battery runs through Chinese processing and manufacturing at multiple stages. Achieving genuine supply chain independence for clean energy requires not just manufacturing but also mineral processing, materials production, and component manufacturing—an integrated ecosystem that will take decades to build even with aggressive policies.

The energy transition thus presents difficult tradeoffs. Pursuing climate goals rapidly requires leveraging existing (Chinese-dominated) supply chains, accepting dependencies as the price of speed. Pursuing supply chain security requires building Western capacity, accepting slower transitions and higher costs. Balancing these objectives—climate urgency and security concerns—defines energy policy debates in the United States and Europe.

## Strategic Resources and Economic Leverage

Beyond food and energy, numerous other resources exhibit concentration, essentiality, or scarcity characteristics that create leverage for possessor nations. This section examines water, phosphates for fertilizer, and resource control more broadly as tools of economic statecraft.

### Water: The Ultimate Existential Resource

Water scarcity increasingly shapes geopolitics, particularly in arid regions where rivers cross borders and aquifers are shared. Unlike oil or rare earths, water has no substitutes and cannot be synthesized—societies require minimum quantities for drinking, agriculture, and industry. This existentiality makes water conflicts especially intractable and water leverage extraordinarily potent.

The Middle East provides multiple examples of water's strategic significance. The Nile River, supplying 85-90% of Egypt's water, flows through Ethiopia, Sudan, and nine other upstream riparians before reaching Egypt. Ethiopia's Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), completed in 2020 and Africa's largest hydroelectric project, gives Addis Ababa control over Nile flows. Egypt views this as an existential threat—any significant reduction in Nile water would devastate Egyptian agriculture and threaten 100+ million people dependent on the river. Egypt has historically threatened military action to protect Nile flows, and the GERD has triggered years of failed negotiations. Ethiopia asserts sovereign right to develop its water resources; Egypt invokes historical water rights and existential need. The conflict illustrates how water dependencies between upstream controllers and downstream dependents create zero-sum competition resistant to compromise.

The Jordan River system supplies Israel, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestinian territories. Israeli control of water resources in the occupied West Bank and Golan Heights grants leverage over Palestinian and Syrian access. Jordan imports roughly 90% of energy and depends heavily on shared aquifers and the Jordan River. Water scarcity constrains economic development and agricultural production across the region, with climate change exacerbating shortages. Water access factored into Israeli-Jordanian peace agreements and remains a source of tension in Israeli-Palestinian relations.

The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, originating in Turkey, flow through Syria and Iraq before reaching the Persian Gulf. Turkey's Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) includes 22 dams and 19 hydropower plants that regulate flows to downstream nations. Syria and Iraq have accused Turkey of weaponizing water by reducing flows during droughts, exacerbating agricultural crises. Turkey denies deliberate restrictions but asserts sovereign rights to develop water resources. No comprehensive water-sharing agreement exists, and Turkish control creates dependency that Damascus and Baghdad cannot easily escape.

Beyond the Middle East, India and Pakistan dispute Indus River waters, with the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty periodically threatened by tensions. India's upstream position allows potential water leverage, though actual restrictions have been limited. China's control of Tibetan Plateau headwaters for the Mekong, Brahmaputra, Indus, and other rivers flowing to India, Bangladesh, Southeast Asia grants Beijing theoretical leverage, though China has not yet weaponized these flows systematically.

Water scarcity will intensify with climate change. The Middle East and North Africa face declining precipitation, rising temperatures increasing evaporation, and growing populations. Competition for scarce water will likely increase, with upstream controllers holding leverage and downstream dependents facing security threats. Unlike energy, where alternatives and efficiency can reduce demand, water requirements are largely fixed—societies need minimum quantities regardless of price or availability. This makes water dependencies particularly dangerous and water conflicts particularly difficult to resolve peacefully.

### Phosphates and Fertilizer Geopolitics

Phosphorus, essential for plant growth and agricultural production, comes from phosphate rock—a finite, geographically concentrated resource without synthetic substitutes. Unlike nitrogen (abundant in the atmosphere and synthesized via Haber-Bosch process), phosphorus must be mined. Global phosphate rock reserves are highly concentrated: Morocco controls approximately 70% of known reserves, with substantial deposits also in China, Algeria, Syria, Russia, and smaller amounts elsewhere.

Morocco's dominance creates potential for long-term leverage. As easy-to-access phosphate deposits in China and the United States deplete over coming decades, global dependence on Moroccan phosphate will increase. Morocco's state-owned OCP Group is the world's largest phosphate producer and exporter, supplying phosphoric acid and fertilizers globally. While current markets remain competitive with multiple producers, Morocco's reserve advantage positions it for growing influence as 21st-century agriculture exhausts more accessible deposits elsewhere.

China's phosphate policy illustrates resource nationalism. Despite substantial reserves, China restricted phosphate exports in the 2000s-2010s to secure domestic supply and encourage domestic value-added processing (producing phosphoric acid and fertilizers rather than exporting raw rock). Phosphate export quotas and taxes reduced Chinese exports from 7-8 million tons annually in the mid-2000s to 1-2 million tons, contributing to global fertilizer price spikes. China's willingness to restrict phosphate despite economic costs demonstrates how resource nationalism can override market incentives when policymakers prioritize domestic supply security.

The broader pattern across fertilizers—nitrogen, phosphate, potash—is increasing resource nationalism and potential for weaponization. The 2021-2022 fertilizer crisis demonstrated how geopolitics (Russian/Belarusian potash sanctions), energy prices (natural gas for ammonia synthesis), and export restrictions (Chinese phosphate, Indian bans during domestic shortages) can combine to create global shortages. Countries dependent on fertilizer imports face agricultural production risks that threaten food security, economic stability, and political legitimacy.

### Rare Earths Revisited: From Chokepoint to Weapon

Chapter 2 examined rare earth supply chains in detail, but rare earths deserve additional attention in the context of resource leverage and export restrictions. China's 85% share of rare earth processing creates a chokepoint, but the 2010 crisis demonstrated China's willingness to weaponize this position for political objectives.

The context: In September 2010, a Chinese fishing trawler collided with Japanese Coast Guard vessels near the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands—disputed territory claimed by both China and Japan. Japan detained the Chinese captain, triggering a diplomatic crisis. China responded by informally restricting rare earth exports to Japan. While China denied official policy, rare earth shipments to Japan ceased at Chinese ports as customs "inspections" delayed clearances indefinitely. Japanese manufacturers dependent on Chinese rare earths for magnets, electronics, and other applications faced immediate supply disruptions.

The restrictions lasted weeks, ending only after Japan released the captain and backed down. But the damage was done: Japan learned that China would use rare earth leverage for political objectives. Japanese responses included diversifying suppliers (though China's dominance limited alternatives), stockpiling rare earths to buffer future disruptions, investing in recycling and substitution research, and supporting development of non-Chinese rare earth mines (Australia's Lynas, American projects). A decade later, China's share of Japanese rare earth imports had declined from 95%+ to 50-60%—still substantial but reduced from absolute dependence.

The 2010 crisis demonstrated several lessons. First, informal restrictions provide plausible deniability while achieving coercive objectives—China could deny policy responsibility while customs and regulations silently implemented restrictions. Second, rare earth leverage is real but finite—extreme use accelerates diversification that erodes future leverage. Third, resource dependencies enable coercion on non-resource issues—the Senkaku/Diaoyu dispute had nothing directly to do with rare earths, but China leveraged rare earth dependence to influence Japanese behavior. Fourth, targets can adapt but slowly and expensively—Japan's partial diversification took a decade and cost billions.

China's 2023 restrictions on gallium, germanium, and graphite exports (discussed in Chapter 2) reflect similar dynamics. Following U.S. semiconductor export controls, China restricted exports of minerals critical for semiconductors and defense applications. The restrictions serve multiple purposes: retaliation signaling Beijing's ability to counter U.S. actions, defense of Chinese strategic interests, and reminder of China's own chokepoint leverage. Whether China will escalate to comprehensive rare earth restrictions in future U.S.-China tensions remains uncertain, but the 2010 precedent demonstrates willingness to use resource leverage even at economic cost.

## Resource Nationalism and Export Restrictions

### The Rise of Resource Nationalism

Resource nationalism—policies prioritizing domestic control and use of natural resources over foreign access or market efficiency—is proliferating globally. Governments increasingly view resources as strategic assets to be leveraged for economic development, geopolitical influence, and national security rather than as commodities to be traded freely in global markets.

Several factors drive this trend. First, **recognition of resource leverage following high-profile weaponization episodes**—Russia's gas cutoffs, China's rare earth restrictions, fertilizer crises—has demonstrated that resource control confers geopolitical power. Countries possessing concentrated resources recognize they hold leverage and are less willing to subordinate strategic advantage to economic efficiency.

Second, **desire to capture value-added processing domestically** rather than exporting raw materials while importing manufactured products. Indonesia's nickel ore export ban exemplifies this logic: rather than exporting low-value ore while importing high-value stainless steel or batteries, Indonesia forces smelting and refining domestically, creating local jobs and capturing more economic value. Similar logic drives proposals for lithium processing in Chile and Argentina, phosphate processing requirements in Morocco, and rare earth downstream integration in China.

Third, **lessons from historical resource exploitation where foreign firms or countries extracted resources with limited benefit to local populations**. Post-colonial nations remember resource extraction during colonial periods that enriched imperial powers while leaving local populations impoverished. Contemporary resource nationalism partly reflects determination to avoid repeating these patterns—ensuring that resource wealth benefits domestic populations rather than foreign shareholders.

Fourth, **competition for strategic resources needed for domestic energy transitions, technology industries, or food security**. As countries pursue electric vehicle industries, renewable energy deployment, or high-tech manufacturing, they require access to critical materials. Resource-rich nations recognize that global demand for lithium, rare earths, and other inputs creates seller's leverage—why sell cheaply when buyers desperately need supply?

Fifth, **geopolitical competition between the United States and China incentivizes leveraging any available source of influence**. China's Belt and Road Initiative investments in African and Latin American mines partly aim to secure resource access. Western governments increasingly view resource dependencies on China as security threats requiring mitigation. This competition pushes resource-rich countries to bargain with both sides, extracting maximum benefits while maintaining flexibility.

### Export Restrictions as Policy Tools

Resource-rich nations employ multiple mechanisms to restrict exports or capture leverage. Understanding these tools is essential for analyzing resource coercion.

**Export bans** prohibit exports of specified resources entirely. Indonesia's 2020 nickel ore export ban forced miners to sell domestically or exit, enabling Indonesia to build smelting capacity and move up the value chain. Russian grain export bans during 2010-2011 and 2022-2023 famines aimed to control domestic food prices despite global shortages. These bans maximize leverage but also alienate trading partners and incentivize alternative supply development.

**Export quotas** limit quantities that can be exported, often below market clearing levels. China employed rare earth export quotas from 2009-2015, restricting annual exports to levels below global demand and driving up prices. Quotas allow countries to balance domestic supply priorities with some continued export revenue and international market access.

**Export licensing requirements** create administrative barriers that delay or discourage exports. China's 2023 restrictions on gallium and germanium require exporters to apply for licenses, with approval processes slow and opaque. Even when licenses are eventually granted, uncertainty and delays disrupt supply chains and signal government willingness to restrict access.

**Resource taxes and tariffs** raise export costs, making domestic processing more attractive than raw material exports. China imposed rare earth export taxes and resource taxes in the 2000s, raising costs for foreign buyers while allowing domestic processors to access inputs cheaply. This tax differential encouraged foreign manufacturers to relocate to China to access cheaper inputs, advancing China's industrial policy objectives.

**Nationalization or majority domestic ownership requirements** place resource assets under government control, enabling direct management of production and exports. Many OPEC members fully or majority state-own oil production. Venezuela, Bolivia, and others have nationalized oil and gas assets previously held by foreign firms. While nationalization doesn't necessarily imply export restrictions, it provides governments tools to implement restrictions more easily than in private market systems.

**Infrastructure bottlenecks** can restrict exports indirectly. Controlling pipelines, ports, or railways needed to transport resources allows governments to slow exports without formal restrictions. Russia's control of pipelines carrying Central Asian gas enables Moscow to constrain exports from Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and others. China's dominance of rare earth processing creates bottlenecks even for non-Chinese rare earth mines that must ship ore to China for refining.

**Informal pressure on companies** allows governments to implement restrictions while denying official policy. China's 2010 rare earth restrictions to Japan operated partly through customs "inspections" and informal guidance to exporters rather than published regulations. This provides plausible deniability and flexibility while achieving coercive objectives.

### Economic and Strategic Tradeoffs

Resource nationalism involves tradeoffs that limit its effectiveness and create vulnerabilities for practicing nations.

**Revenue losses** from export restrictions reduce foreign exchange earnings and government budgets. Russia's 2022 energy export reductions cost tens of billions in lost revenue. Chinese rare earth export restrictions in 2010-2012 raised prices but also reduced export volumes and revenues. For resource-dependent economies, restrictions that reduce revenue can backfire economically even when achieving strategic objectives.

**Acceleration of substitution and diversification** by target countries erodes long-term leverage. Japan's response to 2010 rare earth restrictions included investments in substitution that permanently reduced Japanese rare earth demand. European responses to Russian gas cutoffs include infrastructure (LNG terminals, interconnectors) that permanently reduces future Russian gas market share. Each use of resource leverage incentivizes targets to escape dependency, making future leverage harder to exercise.

**Retaliation risks** from target countries can escalate conflicts. U.S.-China technology restrictions partly reflect responses to Chinese economic coercion, including rare earth leverage. Russia's gas restrictions triggered European sanctions escalation and long-term shifts away from Russian energy. Resource coercion rarely occurs in isolation—targets often retaliate through other economic, diplomatic, or strategic channels.

**Domestic economic costs** from forcing inefficient resource use or processing can outweigh strategic benefits. Indonesia's nickel export ban forced domestic smelting but required massive subsidies and investment, with uncertain economic returns. Phosphate processing in resource-rich but capital-poor countries may produce lower-quality output at higher cost than established processors elsewhere.

**Alienation of trading partners** and reputational costs reduce willingness to depend on the restricting nation for any resources. China's rare earth restrictions damaged its reputation as reliable supplier, encouraging countries to diversify not just rare earths but other Chinese-supplied inputs. Russia's energy cutoffs destroyed decades of trust-building with Europe and ensured long-term loss of market share.

Despite these costs, resource nationalism is proliferating because governments increasingly judge strategic benefits—leverage, value capture, industrial policy advancement—as outweighing economic costs. In an era of great power competition where economic interdependence is viewed as potential vulnerability rather than mutual benefit, resource-rich nations calculate that sacrificing some economic efficiency to capture leverage is worthwhile. This trend suggests that resource dependencies will become more, not less, weaponized over coming decades—making resource security an increasingly central national security challenge.

## Perspective Box: Chinese Views on Resource Security

### Strategic Vulnerability and Resource Security

Chinese strategic thinking about resources is shaped by a pragmatic assessment of vulnerability and a determination to secure the material basis for national rejuvenation. Where the United States has historically been resource-abundant, China faces per-capita scarcities in energy, arable land, and water that drive its foreign policy.

**Strategic Drivers**
Beijing's resource strategy is driven by several core objectives:
*   **Securing the "Nine-Dash Line"**: Control over the South China Sea is viewed not just as a territorial claim but as a critical resource zone for energy and fisheries, essential for feeding a growing population and fueling the economy.
*   **Breaking the "Malacca Dilemma"**: China's heavy reliance on energy imports transiting the Strait of Malacca is seen as a strategic choke point vulnerable to U.S. naval blockade. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) aims to create overland alternatives.
*   **Resource Diplomacy**: Investments in Africa, Latin America, and Central Asia are designed to lock in long-term supply contracts for lithium, cobalt, and copper—essential for China's dominance in the green energy transition.

**Historical Context**
While the **Century of Humiliation** provides a backdrop of historical grievance regarding foreign exploitation, the more pressing driver is the lesson of the Cold War and recent trade wars: relying on foreign adversaries for critical inputs is an unacceptable risk. The Soviet split in 1960 and current U.S. technology controls reinforce the imperative for **self-reliance** (自力更生, zìlì gēngshēng) and diversification.

**Key Chinese Concepts: Resource Security and Strategic Autonomy**

Contemporary Chinese discourse on resources employs specific concepts reflecting historical experiences and current strategic priorities.

**Resource security** (资源安全, zīyuán ānquán) has become a top-level national priority, frequently invoked by Xi Jinping and enshrined in policy documents. The concept encompasses multiple dimensions: sufficient quantity to meet development needs, stable access not subject to foreign disruption, reasonable prices that don't impose unsustainable costs, and diversified sources reducing dependence on any single supplier or route. Resource security is understood not as pure autarky but as strategic resilience—the ability to survive and prosper even if adversaries attempt resource denial.

**Food self-sufficiency** (粮食自给, liángshí zìjǐ) remains paramount despite China's integration into global agricultural markets. China maintains ~95% self-sufficiency in staple grains (rice, wheat, corn)—importing soybeans, dairy, meat, and specialty products but ensuring domestic production of core calories. This reflects traumatic memories of famine (the Great Leap Forward 1958-1962 killed 15-45 million from starvation) and determination never to depend on foreign food for survival. Chinese policy sacrifices agricultural efficiency (supporting uneconomic domestic grain production through subsidies and minimum prices) to maintain self-sufficiency targets. The logic is existential: food imports are acceptable for variety and efficiency, but core food security cannot depend on foreign suppliers who might weaponize access.

**Energy independence** (能源独立, néngyuán dúlì) guides Chinese energy strategy despite China's status as world's largest energy importer. The concept doesn't mean autarky but rather reducing vulnerabilities through diversification, stockpiling, and technological alternatives. China pursues multiple strategies: diversifying oil and gas suppliers (Middle East, Russia, Central Asia, Africa, Latin America), building strategic petroleum reserves (545 million barrels as of 2020, with plans for more), investing in renewable energy to reduce fossil fuel imports (China leads globally in solar, wind, and hydroelectric capacity), developing domestic coal (70% of primary energy, with substantial reserves), and researching advanced technologies (nuclear, hydrogen, synthetic fuels).

The **Belt and Road Initiative** (BRI) serves multiple resource security objectives. Overland routes from China through Central Asia to Europe (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor) provide alternatives to maritime transit through Malacca and U.S.-dominated sea lanes. Investments in port infrastructure across South Asia, Middle East, East Africa, and Mediterranean (**"String of Pearls"** strategy) aim to secure maritime routes and provide naval basing options. Investments in foreign mining (African copper and cobalt, Latin American lithium, Australian iron ore) ensure access even if geopolitical tensions rise. Agricultural investments (land purchases or long-term leases in Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America) provide alternative food sources if traditional suppliers restrict access.

### Official Policies and Strategic Responses

Chinese government responses to resource vulnerabilities span multiple domains, reflecting comprehensive state-led strategies.

**Strategic reserves** buffer supply disruptions and price volatility. Beyond petroleum reserves, China maintains stockpiles of rare earths (ironic given China's production dominance—reserves guard against future scarcity or domestic supply issues), copper, aluminum, soybeans, pork (frozen meat reserves to stabilize prices), and other commodities. These reserves are larger than Western counterparts relative to consumption, reflecting greater anxiety about supply security and willingness to bear storage costs for insurance.

**Vertical integration** aims to control entire supply chains. For critical minerals, China not only processes rare earths (85% global share) but also manufactures downstream products (magnets 90%, phosphors 80%). This integration means disruptions to foreign rare earth mines affect China less than competitors—China can substitute domestic mining or reduce export processing to prioritize domestic users. Similar integration occurs in solar panels (polysilicon through modules) and batteries (lithium processing through cell manufacturing).

**Dual circulation** strategy, introduced in Chapter 2's Chinese Perspective Box, applies to resources. **Internal circulation** involves building domestic capacity: expanding coal mining, developing domestic oil and gas (despite higher costs), investing in renewable energy, and pursuing food self-sufficiency. **External circulation** focuses on diversifying import sources: oil from Middle East, Russia, Africa, and Latin America rather than depending on any one supplier; iron ore from Australia and Brazil; soybeans from Brazil and United States (with capacity to shift entirely to Brazil if U.S. restricts supply).

**Technology substitution** pursues alternatives reducing resource dependencies. Electric vehicles reduce oil imports (though creating battery material dependencies). Nuclear and renewable energy displace coal and gas. Synthetic biology research aims to produce proteins and fats without agricultural land, potentially reducing soybean imports. Seawater desalination addresses water scarcity. Advanced materials research seeks alternatives to critical minerals (rare-earth-free motors, alternative battery chemistries). While many technologies remain aspirational, massive R&D investments reflect commitment to reducing dependencies through innovation.

### Debates and Tensions

Despite official consensus on resource security, debates exist within Chinese policy and academic circles about costs, priorities, and tradeoffs.

**Efficiency versus security** tensions mirror Western debates. Economists argue that prioritizing self-sufficiency reduces growth—China would be richer importing food efficiently rather than subsidizing domestic grain production, and buying rather than building domestic semiconductor capacity. Growth-focused officials worry that excessive resource security spending diverts investment from productive uses. Security hawks counter that dependencies on potential adversaries create unacceptable vulnerabilities, and efficiency arguments ignore historical lessons about weaponized interdependence.

**Leverage versus vulnerability** dilemmas shape resource policy. China's rare earth dominance provides leverage—but using that leverage (2010 restrictions) accelerated diversification that eroded China's position. Similarly, threatening to restrict exports of gallium, germanium, or other minerals signals power but incentivizes substitution. Debates center on whether hoarding leverage (maintaining reliability to preserve market share) or using leverage (accepting market share loss to achieve strategic objectives) better serves Chinese interests.

**Domestic costs versus strategic benefits** create tensions. Food self-sufficiency requires subsidizing inefficient agriculture, environmental degradation from overproduction, and higher food prices for consumers. Energy independence through coal means continued air pollution and carbon emissions. Rare earth mining creates substantial environmental damage in Inner Mongolia. Officials must balance resource security against domestic welfare, environmental protection, and international climate commitments.

### Implications for Global Resource Competition

Chinese resource strategies create several dynamics shaping global competition.

First, **China will not voluntarily become dependent on Western-controlled supply chains for strategic resources**. Post-2018 trade war and semiconductor sanctions reinforced determination to achieve substitutability in critical domains. Western hopes that economic integration would constrain Chinese foreign policy choices underestimate Chinese willingness to sacrifice efficiency for security.

Second, **China's resource investments and BRI create alternative power structures**. Countries dependent on Chinese investment, Chinese markets for resource exports, or Chinese technology (Huawei telecommunications, Alibaba cloud computing, TikTok platforms) gain options beyond Western-led institutions. This doesn't necessarily make them "pro-China" but increases their autonomy from Western pressure—creating a more multipolar resource landscape where neither U.S. nor China fully controls access.

Third, **resource competition will intensify as clean energy transitions increase demand for critical minerals**. China's head start in mineral processing, battery manufacturing, and solar production positions it to dominate clean energy supply chains as the world did with oil. Western energy transitions pursued to reduce fossil fuel dependencies may create deeper dependencies on Chinese-controlled supply chains—a paradox that shapes climate and security policy tensions.

Fourth, **China's resource nationalism (export restrictions on rare earths, gallium, germanium) will escalate if U.S.-China tensions worsen**. China holds substantial resource leverage and has demonstrated willingness to use it. If the United States expands technology restrictions or Taiwan tensions escalate, China might comprehensively weaponize critical mineral exports—inflicting substantial economic pain on the West while accelerating diversification efforts that reduce China's long-term leverage.

Finally, **resource security competition creates opportunities for resource-rich developing nations** to bargain with both great powers. Countries holding lithium (Chile, Argentina, Bolivia), cobalt (DRC, Zambia), rare earth deposits (Vietnam, Brazil, South Africa), or other critical resources can negotiate with United States, China, and others for favorable investment terms, technology transfers, and strategic relationships. This creates a more competitive—and potentially unstable—global resource landscape where resource-rich nations hold greater leverage than during previous eras of resource competition.

The fundamental challenge is that both the United States and China view resource dependencies as security threats requiring mitigation, while simultaneously seeking to leverage their own resource advantages. This creates pressures toward resource nationalism, export restrictions, and competition for control over resource-producing regions. Managing this competition peacefully—ensuring resource flows continue despite geopolitical tensions—requires mechanisms and agreements that neither side has yet prioritized building.

# Tabletop Exercise: Critical Minerals Crisis and Supply Disruption

**Chapter:** 3 - Critical Sectors and Strategic Resources

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Analyze vulnerabilities created by concentrated control of critical minerals
- Evaluate tools for building strategic reserves and diversifying supply sources
- Understand environmental, economic, and geopolitical trade-offs in resource security
- Assess effectiveness of retaliation and counter-coercion in resource conflicts

## Scenario Overview

**Date: June 2027**

Following a U.S. decision to impose new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and solar panels under Section 301, China announces "temporary export controls" on gallium, germanium, and several rare earth elements "for national security reasons." The measures require Chinese exporters to obtain licenses for shipments to "unfriendly countries," which in practice means the United States and allies supporting the tariffs.

China produces 98% of global gallium, 60% of germanium, and dominates rare earth processing (85%+ global capacity). These materials are critical for:
- **Defense:** Missile guidance systems, radar, satellite communications, night vision equipment
- **Clean energy:** Wind turbines, electric vehicle motors, solar panels
- **Electronics:** Smartphones, fiber optics, semiconductors, LED lighting

Within two weeks, U.S. defense contractors report critical shortfalls. Prices for available gallium spike 400%. Major renewable energy projects face delays. The Pentagon warns that missile production and F-35 maintenance could be affected within 3-6 months.

Allied reactions are mixed: Japan and Australia support U.S. tariffs but need rare earth access; the EU opposes tariffs and seeks separate accommodation with China. Several African and Latin American countries with potential rare earth deposits are courting both U.S. and Chinese investment.

You are convened as an interagency task force to develop immediate responses and long-term critical mineral security strategy.

## Participant Roles

**Deputy National Security Advisor**
- Responsibilities: Coordinate national security response, manage escalation

**EPA Administrator**
- Responsibilities: Environmental regulations, mining waste, community impacts
- Interests: Protecting environment and public health
- Constraints: Rare earth processing creates toxic waste, limited U.S. processing capacity

## Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Immediate Supply Crisis (Minutes 0-20)

**Inject 1: Defense Production at Risk**

Pentagon assessment shows:
- Raytheon: 4-month supply of gallium for missile production; will halt new production within 90 days
- Lockheed Martin: F-35 maintenance requires rare earth magnets; current stockpile lasts 6 months
- Northrop Grumman: Satellite systems require germanium; limited alternatives
- General Dynamics: Night vision equipment production affected immediately

Defense contractors request:
1. Emergency release of Defense National Stockpile materials
2. Defense Production Act authority to prioritize their access to global supplies
3. Relaxation of export controls to source from any available supplier (including Russian or Iranian intermediaries)

**Key Questions:**
1. Should the U.S. immediately release strategic stockpile materials, even though current stocks are limited and building new reserves could take years?
2. Do you prioritize defense over clean energy industries for available rare earth supplies?
3. Should the U.S. retaliate with its own export controls on critical goods where it has leverage (e.g., specialized equipment, agricultural products)?

### Phase 2: Allied Divergence and Alternative Sources (Minutes 20-45)

**Inject 2: Allied Fragmentation**

- **Japan:** Proposes joint U.S.-Japan rare earth stockpile but requests U.S. share costs; has some existing stockpiles
- **Australia:** Willing to accelerate Lynas rare earth production but needs $2 billion U.S. investment and technology transfers; production increase takes 18-24 months
- **EU:** Refuses to join any counter-measures against China; negotiating separate rare earth supply agreement with Beijing
- **South Korea:** Caught between U.S. alliance and economic dependence on China; seeking to stay neutral

**Inject 3: Problematic Alternative Sources**

Several alternative supply options emerge, all with complications:

- **Myanmar:** Has rare earth deposits but controlled by military junta under U.S. sanctions; Chinese firms already operating there
- **Greenland:** Rare earth deposits available but Denmark/Greenland hesitant due to environmental concerns and Chinese influence
- **Central Asia:** Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have deposits but require massive infrastructure investment and have close Russia/China ties
- **Democratic Republic of Congo:** Cobalt and some rare earths available but severe governance, human rights, and environmental concerns
- **Domestic (California, Alaska):** Mountain Pass mine could increase production but faces environmental lawsuits; expansion requires 2-3 years and $500 million+

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you balance speed (sourcing from problematic suppliers) versus values (human rights, environment, sanctions compliance)?
2. What investments should the U.S. make in alternative sources, knowing they won't help the immediate crisis?
3. How do you coordinate with allies who have different interests and China dependencies?

### Phase 3: Strategic Decisions and Escalation Risk (Minutes 45-70)

**Inject 4: China Escalates**

Intelligence reports that China is:
- Offering long-term rare earth contracts to European firms if they oppose U.S. tariffs
- Increasing rare earth shipments to Russia and Iran as geopolitical favor
- Restricting neodymium (critical for EV motors) to pressure U.S. auto industry
- Using rare earth leverage to demand U.S. remove sanctions on specific Chinese tech firms

Chinese state media declares that "those who seek to contain China will find their own development contained."

**Inject 5: Domestic Political Pressure**

- **Defense industry:** Demands government action; warns of military readiness gaps
- **Clean energy sector:** Warns that wind and EV production will collapse; blames administration's China policy for crisis
- **Environmental groups:** Oppose fast-tracking domestic mining; file lawsuits against emergency permits
- **Labor unions:** Support domestic mining for jobs but demand environmental and safety protections
- **Congress:** Bipartisan criticism; hearings scheduled; legislation proposed to mandate domestic rare earth production

**Decision Required:** Long-term critical minerals strategy including:
1. Immediate crisis mitigation (stockpile release, emergency imports, rationing)
2. Medium-term diversification (investments in alternative sources, allied coordination)
3. Long-term self-reliance (domestic production, recycling, substitution R&D)
4. Response to Chinese coercion (retaliation, accommodation, or de-escalation)
5. Policy reforms (permitting, environmental regulations, subsidies, strategic reserves)

**Key Questions:**
1. How much economic cost and environmental compromise is acceptable to achieve critical mineral security?
2. Should the U.S. retaliate with its own export controls, knowing this escalates economic conflict?
3. What is the right balance between domestic production (slow, expensive, environmental concerns) and diversified imports (faster but still creates dependencies)?
4. How do you structure long-term contracts and investments to ensure supply reliability?

### Phase 4: Debrief and Analysis (Minutes 70-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Vulnerability Assessment:** How did concentrated Chinese control of rare earths create coercive leverage? Could this vulnerability have been reduced earlier?

2. **Resilience vs. Cost:** Domestic rare earth production is 2-3x more expensive than Chinese supply. How do you justify taxpayer and consumer costs for supply security?

3. **Environmental Trade-offs:** Rare earth mining and processing create environmental damage. How did you balance environmental protection against resource security?

4. **Allied Coordination:** Why was allied unity difficult? How could burden-sharing be structured to align incentives?

5. **Retaliation Calculus:** If the U.S. retaliates with its own export controls, does this escalate toward economic decoupling? What are the risks and benefits?

6. **Long-term Strategy:** What mix of stockpiling, diversification, domestic production, recycling, and substitution research is optimal?

7. **Unintended Consequences:**
   - Impact on clean energy transition if rare earths become scarce/expensive
   - Chinese response to U.S. efforts to reduce dependence
   - Environmental and indigenous community impacts of accelerated mining
   - Precedent for future resource weapon ization

8. **China's Perspective:** From Beijing's viewpoint, why use rare earths as leverage? What does this reveal about Chinese strategic thinking?

## Background Materials

**Key Authorities:**
- Defense Production Act, 50 U.S.C. § 4501 et seq.
- Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, 50 U.S.C. § 98 et seq.
- Energy Act of 2020 (critical minerals provisions)
- Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (rare earth programs)

**Critical Mineral Data:**
- Chinese rare earth production: 60% of mining, 85%+ of processing
- U.S. imports: 80% of rare earth elements from China (2019)
- Defense uses: $500 million+ annually in rare earths for weapons systems
- Clean energy: Each wind turbine requires ~500 kg of rare earths; each EV motor ~1-2 kg
- Price volatility: Previous Chinese restrictions (2010-2011) caused 10x price spikes

**Alternative Sources:**
- U.S. domestic: Mountain Pass (California) only operating mine; several deposits in Alaska, Wyoming
- Australia: Lynas Corporation, second-largest rare earth processor
- Greenland: Kvanefjeld deposit, politically sensitive
- Recycling: Currently <1% of rare earths recycled; technology improving

**Recent Precedents:**
- 2010 Japan-China rare earth dispute following Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands incident
- July 2023 China export controls on gallium and germanium
- U.S. government studies identifying rare earths as critical vulnerability (2017, 2019, 2021)

## Facilitator Notes

**Setup:**
- Provide simple chart showing rare earth supply chain (mining → processing → manufacturing)
- Have participants review basics of rare earth uses before exercise
- Consider field trip video or images of rare earth mining environmental impacts

**Time Management:**
- Phase 1: Focus on immediate triage and prioritization
- Phase 2: Emphasize difficult trade-offs (speed vs. values, cost vs. security)
- Phase 3: Force concrete recommendations with budgets and timelines
- Phase 4: Extract lessons about resource dependencies and strategic competition

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Assuming domestic production can quickly replace imports (takes 5-10 years minimum)
- Underestimating environmental obstacles to mining expansion
- Treating "alternative sources" as fungible (each has unique political/technical issues)
- Neglecting clean energy impacts (delays renewable deployment)

**Extension Options:**
- Add simultaneous crisis in another critical mineral (lithium, cobalt)
- Include China offering to negotiate if U.S. makes concessions on Taiwan
- Simulate environmental lawsuit halting expedited mining permits
- Add competing demands from private sector for rare earths (tech vs. defense vs. energy)

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this exercise, participants should be able to:

1. **Assess critical mineral vulnerabilities** and identify systemic dependencies on concentrated suppliers

2. **Evaluate resilience strategies** including stockpiling, diversification, domestic production, recycling, and substitution

3. **Navigate environmental and social trade-offs** inherent in critical mineral security

4. **Understand limitations** of rapid supply chain restructuring and time required for new production

5. **Analyze adversary leverage** and develop counter-coercion strategies
