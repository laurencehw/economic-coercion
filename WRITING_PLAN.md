- Historical context: Embargoes and restrictions during Cold War, post-2018 trade war
- Strategic logic: Self-reliance (自力更生) vs. economic efficiency
- Key Chinese concepts:
  - **Chokepoint** (卡脖子, qiǎ bózi): "Strangling the neck" - critical dependencies
  - **Indigenous Innovation** (自主创新, zìzhǔ chuàngxīn): Domestic technological development
  - **Dual Circulation** (双循环, shuāng xúnhuán): Domestic self-sufficiency + international engagement
- Official positions: Made in China 2025, semiconductor self-sufficiency, rare earth leverage
- Debates within China: Costs of autarky vs. benefits of specialization
- Implications for U.S. strategy: China will sacrifice efficiency for security

#### Case Study 1: 2010 China-Japan Rare Earth Crisis (900 words)
- Background: Japan detained Chinese fishing captain near Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands
- Chinese response: Informal rare earth export restrictions to Japan
- Impact: Japanese rare earth imports from China dropped 40%
