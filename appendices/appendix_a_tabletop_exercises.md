## Tabletop Exercise: Taiwan Strait Economic Coercion Crisis

**Chapter:** 1 - Foundations of Economic Statecraft in the 21st Century

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply the framework of economic coercion (tools, targets, objectives, effectiveness) to a realistic crisis scenario
- Analyze trade-offs between economic leverage, allied coordination, and escalation risks
- Understand how Chinese and U.S. perspectives on sovereignty and economic interdependence shape crisis responses
- Evaluate the effectiveness of different economic statecraft tools in a high-stakes environment

### Scenario Overview

**Date: January 15, 2026**

Taiwan's newly elected president has announced plans to pursue formal constitutional changes that Beijing views as steps toward de jure independence. In response, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has initiated large-scale military exercises encircling Taiwan, including a partial naval blockade that disrupts commercial shipping. China has not declared war but characterizes the exercises as "internal law enforcement operations."

The United States faces pressure from Taiwan, Japan, and other Indo-Pacific allies to respond with both security guarantees and economic measures. However, the U.S.-China economic relationship remains deeply intertwined: China holds $850 billion in U.S. Treasury securities, bilateral trade exceeds $700 billion annually, and U.S. firms depend on Chinese supply chains for critical inputs. China, meanwhile, remains dependent on Taiwan for advanced semiconductors, U.S. semiconductor equipment, and access to Western financial systems.

You are members of the National Security Council Deputies Committee convened to develop economic response options for the President. The crisis is escalating, and decisions made in the next 48-72 hours may determine whether the situation resolves diplomatically, escalates to comprehensive economic warfare, or spirals into military conflict.

### Participant Roles

**National Security Advisor (NSA)**
- Responsibilities: Chair the meeting, synthesize recommendations for the President
- Interests: Managing escalation, maintaining allied unity, protecting U.S. security interests
- Constraints: Presidential directive to avoid military conflict if possible

**Deputy Secretary of State**
- Responsibilities: Allied coordination, diplomatic options, international law
- Interests: Maintaining alliance credibility, avoiding rupture with China, UN engagement
- Constraints: Allies have divergent economic exposures to China

**Deputy Secretary of Treasury**
- Responsibilities: Financial sanctions, dollar system, economic impact assessment
- Interests: Financial system stability, minimizing market disruption, sanctions effectiveness
- Constraints: Federal Reserve independence, market volatility, dollar weaponization concerns

**Deputy Secretary of Commerce**
- Responsibilities: Export controls, semiconductor policy, technology restrictions
- Interests: Protecting U.S. technology leadership, maintaining industry competitiveness
- Constraints: Industry opposition, allied semiconductor firm dependencies

**Deputy Secretary of Defense**
- Responsibilities: Military readiness, defense industrial base, operational requirements
- Interests: Ensuring military capability, Taiwan defense, deterring Chinese aggression
- Constraints: Reliance on Chinese rare earths, limited munitions stockpiles

**Deputy Director of National Intelligence**
- Responsibilities: Intelligence assessment, adversary intentions, effectiveness estimates
- Interests: Accurate intelligence, protecting sources/methods
- Constraints: Intelligence gaps on Chinese leadership decision-making

### Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Initial Crisis Response (Minutes 0-20)

**Inject 1: Blockade Tightens**

China announces that all vessels approaching Taiwan must receive approval from Chinese maritime authorities. Three commercial cargo ships are turned away. Taiwan reports that PLA Navy vessels are stopping and inspecting merchant ships in international waters. Japan and South Korea express concern that their trade with Taiwan (including critical semiconductor imports) is being disrupted.

**Intelligence Assessment:** China appears to be implementing a "quarantine" rather than a full blockade, claiming authority to inspect vessels for military materials. However, the practical effect is severe disruption to Taiwan's trade. Beijing has mobilized economic ministries to implement potential counter-coercion against countries supporting Taiwan.

**Key Questions:**
1. Should the U.S. immediately announce economic sanctions, or wait to coordinate with allies?
2. Which economic tools provide the most leverage with acceptable escalation risk: financial sanctions, export controls, trade restrictions, or a combination?
3. How do you balance signaling resolve to Taiwan and allies against avoiding steps that make Chinese de-escalation politically impossible?

### Phase 2: Allied Coordination and Chinese Threats (Minutes 20-45)

**Inject 2: Allied Discord**

Japan signals willingness to join coordinated sanctions but requests exemptions for energy imports from China. South Korea is hesitant, fearing Chinese economic retaliation against its auto and electronics exports. The EU issues a statement condemning the blockade but takes no concrete action. Taiwan urgently requests that the U.S. freeze Chinese assets and ban semiconductor equipment exports to China.

**Inject 3: Chinese Counter-Threats**

China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson warns that "countries interfering in China's internal affairs will face resolute countermeasures." Reports indicate China is preparing to:
- Restrict rare earth exports to the U.S. and allies
- Launch investigations into U.S. firms under Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law
- Reduce purchases of U.S. Treasury securities
- Ban U.S. agricultural imports
- Cut off supply of critical pharmaceutical precursors

**Key Questions:**
1. How important is multilateral coordination, and are you willing to delay action to achieve it?
2. How do you assess the credibility of Chinese counter-coercion threats, and how would Chinese retaliation affect the U.S. economy and political sustainability of sanctions?
3. Should the U.S. implement "defensive" economic measures (e.g., diversifying supply chains, building stockpiles) before imposing sanctions on China?

### Phase 3: Escalation and Decision Point (Minutes 45-70)

**Inject 4: Maritime Incident**

A U.S. Navy destroyer conducting a freedom of navigation operation is "painted" by Chinese targeting radar. No shots are fired, but tensions spike. The PLA announces an expanded military exercise zone that effectively closes the Taiwan Strait to commercial traffic.

Taiwan's president appeals directly to the U.S. President for "meaningful economic consequences" for China's actions. Domestic political pressure is mounting: both hawkish members of Congress and U.S. business groups are calling for action, though with very different recommendations.

**Inject 5: Semiconductor Leverage**

Taiwan's government indicates it is considering halting semiconductor exports to China (which would cripple Chinese tech industry) if the U.S. and allies take strong economic action. However, this would also disrupt global supply chains and harm TSMC's business model. China has reportedly put Chinese firms on notice to reduce dependencies on U.S. technology, accelerating indigenous semiconductor development regardless of cost.

**Decision Required:** The President needs recommendations within 24 hours on:
1. Which economic measures to implement, if any
2. Conditions for reversing those measures
3. Coordination strategy with allies
4. Mitigation of likely Chinese counter-coercion
5. Off-ramps for de-escalation

**Key Questions:**
1. Do you recommend comprehensive sanctions (SWIFT exclusion, asset freezes, export controls) or calibrated measures (targeted sanctions, limited export controls)?
2. What objectives are realistic: compelling China to end the blockade (compellence), deterring future aggression (deterrence), or degrading Chinese capabilities (denial)?
3. How do you sequence economic measures to preserve escalation options while signaling resolve?
4. What intelligence would change your assessment, and how do you hedge against uncertainty about Chinese decision-making?

### Phase 4: Debrief and Analysis (Minutes 70-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Effectiveness Assessment:** Which economic tools provided the most leverage relative to costs? What made certain tools more or less effective?

2. **Allied Coordination:** How did divergent allied interests affect your strategy? Could you have structured measures to accommodate allied concerns while maintaining pressure?

3. **Chinese Perspective:** How might Chinese leaders interpret different U.S. actions? Which measures would Beijing view as crossing red lines versus acceptable responses?

4. **Escalation Dynamics:** Did economic coercion reduce or increase the risk of military conflict? How do you prevent an economic spiral that makes diplomatic off-ramps impossible?

5. **Second-Order Effects:** What long-term consequences would your chosen measures create for:
   - U.S.-China economic relationship
   - Dollar's role in international finance
   - Allied trust in U.S. leadership
   - Chinese pursuit of economic self-reliance
   - Global economic stability

6. **Domestic Politics:** How sustainable is your chosen approach given U.S. domestic politics, economic interests, and public opinion?

7. **Alternative Scenarios:** How would your recommendations change if:
   - China declared a full military blockade rather than a "quarantine"
   - Taiwan took provocative actions (e.g., declaring independence) that complicated U.S. messaging
   - Russia opened a simultaneous crisis in Europe, dividing U.S. attention and allied commitment

- Phase 2: 25 minutes - emphasize allied coordination challenges and Chinese counter-threats
- Phase 3: 25 minutes - force concrete recommendations
- Phase 4: 20-30 minutes - critical for extracting lessons

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Participants defaulting to military rather than economic tools (redirect to economic focus)
- Unrealistic assumptions about allied unity (emphasize divergent interests)
- Treating Chinese responses as passive (inject credible counter-coercion)
- Neglecting second-order effects and long-term consequences (probe these explicitly)

**Extension Options:**
- Add roles for Chinese decision-makers to simulate red-teaming
- Include a market response inject (stock market crash, dollar volatility)
- Simulate a second iteration 6 months later to evaluate chosen strategy's sustainability

**Variations:**

- For policy focus: Emphasize domestic political constraints and Congressional reactions
- For economics focus: Provide detailed economic modeling of sanctions impact

### Learning Outcomes

After completing this exercise, participants should be able to:

1. **Apply the economic coercion framework** to analyze tools (sanctions, export controls, financial measures), targets (state, firms, individuals), objectives (compellence, deterrence, denial), and effectiveness factors

2. **Evaluate trade-offs** between economic leverage and costs, immediate signaling and long-term sustainability, unilateral action and multilateral coordination

3. **Understand adversary perspectives** on how Chinese leaders might interpret different U.S. actions based on historical experiences and strategic objectives

4. **Assess escalation risks** inherent in weaponizing economic interdependence in a crisis environment

5. **Recognize intelligence gaps and uncertainty** in crisis decision-making about adversary intentions and resolve

## Tabletop Exercise: Semiconductor Chokepoint Crisis

**Chapter:** 2 - Supply Chain Vulnerabilities and Dependencies

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Analyze chokepoint vulnerabilities in global supply chains
- Evaluate tools for supply chain resilience and diversification
- Understand trade-offs between economic efficiency and strategic autonomy
- Assess effectiveness of export controls and investment restrictions in protecting critical supply chains

### Scenario Overview

**Date: March 2027**

A major earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale strikes central Taiwan, causing significant damage to infrastructure in Hsinchu Science Park, home to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and dozens of supporting firms. While TSMC's advanced fabs have earthquake protection, several critical facilities suffer damage that will take 4-6 months to fully repair. TSMC announces that production of advanced 3nm and 5nm chips will be reduced by approximately 40% for at least four months.

Global markets react with panic. Within 48 hours, major automotive manufacturers announce production slowdowns due to anticipated chip shortages. Apple, NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm stocks drop 15-20%. The White House receives urgent calls from industry leaders requesting government intervention.

Simultaneously, intelligence reports indicate that China is considering using this crisis as a "window of opportunity" to pressure Taiwan, potentially by offering emergency semiconductor supplies in exchange for political concessions. Chinese state media emphasizes that "the reunification of the motherland would prevent such vulnerabilities."

You are members of the National Economic Council and National Security Council convened to develop both immediate crisis response and longer-term supply chain resilience strategies.

### Participant Roles

**Director of National Economic Council (NEC)**
- Responsibilities: Coordinate economic policy response, balance industry and security interests

- Interests: Supporting U.S. semiconductor industry, maintaining technology leadership
- Constraints: CHIPS Act funding already allocated, limited leverage over private firms

**Deputy Secretary of Defense**
- Responsibilities: Defense industrial base, military systems dependent on advanced chips
- Interests: Ensuring military access to cutting-edge semiconductors, preventing Chinese advantage
- Constraints: Defense programs face multi-year delays if chip supplies interrupted

**Deputy Secretary of State**
- Responsibilities: Diplomatic coordination with Taiwan, allies, and China
- Interests: Supporting Taiwan, managing China relations, allied coordination
- Constraints: Taiwan is sovereign in semiconductor decisions, allies have competing interests

**Deputy Secretary of Treasury**
- Responsibilities: Market stability, economic impact assessment, sanctions if needed
- Interests: Preventing market panic, maintaining economic growth
- Constraints: Cannot directly control private markets, fiscal limits on subsidies

**CEO Representative (Private Sector Advisor)**
- Responsibilities: Represent major tech firms dependent on TSMC supply
- Interests: Restoring chip supply, protecting market position, avoiding government overreach
- Constraints: No authority over TSMC, competitive pressures, shareholder accountability

### Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Immediate Crisis (Minutes 0-20)

**Inject 1: Supply Chain Assessment**

Initial assessments indicate:
- Apple: 60% of advanced chips sourced from damaged facilities; iPhone production at risk
- Auto industry: Already fragile chip supplies; this will force plant closures within weeks
- Defense contractors: Weapons systems requiring advanced chips face delays
- Data center operators: AI chip shortages will slow cloud infrastructure expansion

TSMC requests U.S. assistance with specialized equipment and materials to accelerate repairs. Japanese and Dutch lithography equipment manufacturers are offering expedited support, but Chinese firms are offering immediate alternative production capacity at older nodes.

**Key Questions:**
1. What immediate steps should the U.S. government take to manage the crisis: emergency CHIPS Act funding, Defense Production Act authorities, diplomatic coordination?
2. Should the U.S. encourage or discourage firms from using Chinese alternative production capacity?
3. How do you balance market forces (allowing firms to source chips wherever available) against security concerns (preventing Chinese leverage over U.S. tech industry)?

### Phase 2: Chinese Pressure and Allied Divergence (Minutes 20-45)

**Inject 2: China's Strategic Offer**

China's government announces an emergency program offering to prioritize semiconductor production for "Chinese and friendly markets" to compensate for Taiwan's disruption. Chinese state-owned firms contact major U.S. tech companies offering guaranteed chip supplies for the next 12 months at favorable prices.

Taiwan's government reports that Beijing has quietly communicated that "unnecessary tensions and provocations" could affect China's willingness to provide economic assistance during Taiwan's recovery. Intelligence suggests China may be preparing to restrict rare earth exports needed for semiconductor manufacturing as additional leverage.

**Inject 3: Allied Semiconductor Competition**

- **South Korea:** Samsung announces major production expansion but prioritizes Korean and European customers; hints that U.S. export control cooperation depends on preferential access
- **Japan:** Willing to expedite equipment to Taiwan but requests U.S. reconsider restrictions on Japanese firms selling to Chinese customers
- **EU:** Announces €20 billion emergency semiconductor fund; Commissioner publicly criticizes U.S. "America First" semiconductor policy

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you prevent Chinese economic leverage over U.S. firms without driving them to bankruptcy?
2. What incentives or requirements should accompany any government assistance to industry?
3. How do you coordinate with allies who have competing semiconductor ambitions?

### Phase 3: Long-Term Strategy Decision (Minutes 45-70)

**Inject 4: Strategic Choices**

Intelligence assessment projects:
- TSMC Taiwan recovery: 4-6 months to 80% capacity, 12-18 months to full capacity
- China accelerating indigenous semiconductor development; may achieve 7nm production within 2 years
- U.S. domestic fab construction (CHIPS Act funded): Still 2-3 years from volume production

Industry coalition proposes:
1. $50 billion emergency fund for domestic fab acceleration
2. Waiver of certain environmental reviews to speed construction
3. Government-backed insurance for semiconductor supply disruptions
4. Relaxation of export controls to allow U.S. firms to maintain Chinese market share

National security team proposes:
1. Mandatory supply chain diversification requirements for critical industries
2. Stricter export controls to prevent any advanced technology reaching China
3. Strategic reserve of critical semiconductors (similar to oil reserve)
4. Accelerated TSMC Arizona production even at higher costs

**Inject 5: Taiwan Vulnerability**

Taiwan's president publicly states that the earthquake demonstrates the need for international support for Taiwan's security, linking semiconductor supply reliability to Taiwan's political status. This draws sharp Chinese condemnation and veiled military threats.

U.S. firms express concern that overly politicizing semiconductors will damage business relationships and innovation ecosystems. Some suggest the U.S. should separate economic and security issues to maintain industry competitiveness.

**Decision Required:** Recommendations for:
1. Immediate crisis mitigation (0-6 months)
2. Medium-term resilience building (1-3 years)
3. Long-term supply chain restructuring (3-10 years)
4. Policy toward China's semiconductor industry and firms using Chinese capacity
5. Allied coordination and burden-sharing

**Key Questions:**
1. How much economic inefficiency and cost is acceptable to achieve supply chain security?
2. Should the government mandate private sector behavior (e.g., prohibit using Chinese chips) or rely on incentives?
3. What is the right balance between allied diversification (Europe, Japan, Korea) and domestic reshoring?
4. How do you handle the tension between maintaining U.S. semiconductor competitiveness and denying China access to advanced technology?

### Phase 4: Debrief and Analysis (Minutes 70-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Chokepoint Vulnerability:** What made Taiwan semiconductors such a critical chokepoint? Could this vulnerability have been reduced through prior policy choices?

2. **Resilience vs. Efficiency:** How did you balance the economic costs of diversification/reshoring against security benefits? What metrics should guide this trade-off?

3. **Private Sector Coordination:** How did you align private sector incentives (profitability, market share) with national security objectives? Were mandates or incentives more effective?

4. **Allied Coordination:** Why is coordinating semiconductor policy among allies difficult? How did you structure burden-sharing?

5. **China Strategic Leverage:** How did you prevent China from using the crisis to gain leverage over Taiwan or U.S. firms? Did your approach reduce or increase long-term Chinese leverage?

6. **Unintended Consequences:** What second-order effects might your policies create:
   - Impact on U.S. tech industry innovation and competitiveness
   - Chinese response (accelerated self-reliance, retaliation)
   - Allied relations and trust
   - Global semiconductor market structure

7. **Timeframe Mismatches:** How did you manage the gap between immediate needs (chips now), medium-term buildout (2-3 years), and long-term restructuring (5-10 years)?

## Tabletop Exercise: Critical Minerals Crisis and Supply Disruption

**Chapter:** 3 - Critical Sectors and Strategic Resources

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Analyze vulnerabilities created by concentrated control of critical minerals
- Evaluate tools for building strategic reserves and diversifying supply sources
- Understand environmental, economic, and geopolitical trade-offs in resource security
- Assess effectiveness of retaliation and counter-coercion in resource conflicts

### Scenario Overview

**Date: June 2027**

Following a U.S. decision to impose new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and solar panels under Section 301, China announces "temporary export controls" on gallium, germanium, and several rare earth elements "for national security reasons." The measures require Chinese exporters to obtain licenses for shipments to "unfriendly countries," which in practice means the United States and allies supporting the tariffs.

China produces 98% of global gallium, 60% of germanium, and dominates rare earth processing (85%+ global capacity). These materials are critical for:
- **Defense:** Missile guidance systems, radar, satellite communications, night vision equipment
- **Clean energy:** Wind turbines, electric vehicle motors, solar panels
- **Electronics:** Smartphones, fiber optics, semiconductors, LED lighting

Within two weeks, U.S. defense contractors report critical shortfalls. Prices for available gallium spike 400%. Major renewable energy projects face delays. The Pentagon warns that missile production and F-35 maintenance could be affected within 3-6 months.

Allied reactions are mixed: Japan and Australia support U.S. tariffs but need rare earth access; the EU opposes tariffs and seeks separate accommodation with China. Several African and Latin American countries with potential rare earth deposits are courting both U.S. and Chinese investment.

You are convened as an interagency task force to develop immediate responses and long-term critical mineral security strategy.

### Participant Roles

**Deputy National Security Advisor**
- Responsibilities: Coordinate national security response, manage escalation
- Interests: Protecting defense capabilities, avoiding military vulnerability
- Constraints: Limited short-term options to replace Chinese supplies

**Deputy Secretary of Defense**
- Responsibilities: Defense industrial base, military readiness, weapons production
- Interests: Ensuring defense contractors can maintain production
- Constraints: Strategic stockpile limited, alternative sources need years to develop

**Deputy Secretary of Energy**
- Responsibilities: Clean energy transition, critical mineral supply chains
- Interests: Advancing renewable energy deployment, energy independence
- Constraints: Wind and EV industries dependent on Chinese rare earths

**Deputy Secretary of Commerce**
- Responsibilities: Industrial policy, mining sector development, trade policy
- Interests: Building domestic critical mineral capacity, supporting U.S. industries
- Constraints: Environmental regulations, permitting delays (5-10 years for new mines)

**Deputy Secretary of Interior**
- Responsibilities: Federal lands, mining permits, environmental protection
- Interests: Balancing resource development with conservation
- Constraints: Environmental groups oppose accelerated mining, indigenous land rights

**EPA Administrator**
- Responsibilities: Environmental regulations, mining waste, community impacts
- Interests: Protecting environment and public health
- Constraints: Rare earth processing creates toxic waste, limited U.S. processing capacity

### Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Immediate Supply Crisis (Minutes 0-20)

**Inject 1: Defense Production at Risk**

Pentagon assessment shows:
- Raytheon: 4-month supply of gallium for missile production; will halt new production within 90 days
- Lockheed Martin: F-35 maintenance requires rare earth magnets; current stockpile lasts 6 months
- Northrop Grumman: Satellite systems require germanium; limited alternatives
- General Dynamics: Night vision equipment production affected immediately

Defense contractors request:
1. Emergency release of Defense National Stockpile materials
2. Defense Production Act authority to prioritize their access to global supplies
3. Relaxation of export controls to source from any available supplier (including Russian or Iranian intermediaries)

**Key Questions:**
1. Should the U.S. immediately release strategic stockpile materials, even though current stocks are limited and building new reserves could take years?
2. Do you prioritize defense over clean energy industries for available rare earth supplies?
3. Should the U.S. retaliate with its own export controls on critical goods where it has leverage (e.g., specialized equipment, agricultural products)?

### Phase 2: Allied Divergence and Alternative Sources (Minutes 20-45)

**Inject 2: Allied Fragmentation**

- **Japan:** Proposes joint U.S.-Japan rare earth stockpile but requests U.S. share costs; has some existing stockpiles
- **Australia:** Willing to accelerate Lynas rare earth production but needs $2 billion U.S. investment and technology transfers; production increase takes 18-24 months
- **EU:** Refuses to join any counter-measures against China; negotiating separate rare earth supply agreement with Beijing
- **South Korea:** Caught between U.S. alliance and economic dependence on China; seeking to stay neutral

**Inject 3: Problematic Alternative Sources**

Several alternative supply options emerge, all with complications:

- **Myanmar:** Has rare earth deposits but controlled by military junta under U.S. sanctions; Chinese firms already operating there
- **Greenland:** Rare earth deposits available but Denmark/Greenland hesitant due to environmental concerns and Chinese influence
- **Central Asia:** Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have deposits but require massive infrastructure investment and have close Russia/China ties
- **Democratic Republic of Congo:** Cobalt and some rare earths available but severe governance, human rights, and environmental concerns
- **Domestic (California, Alaska):** Mountain Pass mine could increase production but faces environmental lawsuits; expansion requires 2-3 years and $500 million+

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you balance speed (sourcing from problematic suppliers) versus values (human rights, environment, sanctions compliance)?
2. What investments should the U.S. make in alternative sources, knowing they won't help the immediate crisis?
3. How do you coordinate with allies who have different interests and China dependencies?

### Phase 3: Strategic Decisions and Escalation Risk (Minutes 45-70)

**Inject 4: China Escalates**

Intelligence reports that China is:
- Offering long-term rare earth contracts to European firms if they oppose U.S. tariffs
- Increasing rare earth shipments to Russia and Iran as geopolitical favor
- Restricting neodymium (critical for EV motors) to pressure U.S. auto industry
- Using rare earth leverage to demand U.S. remove sanctions on specific Chinese tech firms

Chinese state media declares that "those who seek to contain China will find their own development contained."

**Inject 5: Domestic Political Pressure**

- **Defense industry:** Demands government action; warns of military readiness gaps
- **Clean energy sector:** Warns that wind and EV production will collapse; blames administration's China policy for crisis
- **Environmental groups:** Oppose fast-tracking domestic mining; file lawsuits against emergency permits
- **Labor unions:** Support domestic mining for jobs but demand environmental and safety protections
- **Congress:** Bipartisan criticism; hearings scheduled; legislation proposed to mandate domestic rare earth production

**Decision Required:** Long-term critical minerals strategy including:
1. Immediate crisis mitigation (stockpile release, emergency imports, rationing)
2. Medium-term diversification (investments in alternative sources, allied coordination)
3. Long-term self-reliance (domestic production, recycling, substitution R&D)
4. Response to Chinese coercion (retaliation, accommodation, or de-escalation)
5. Policy reforms (permitting, environmental regulations, subsidies, strategic reserves)

**Key Questions:**
1. How much economic cost and environmental compromise is acceptable to achieve critical mineral security?
2. Should the U.S. retaliate with its own export controls, knowing this escalates economic conflict?
3. What is the right balance between domestic production (slow, expensive, environmental concerns) and diversified imports (faster but still creates dependencies)?
4. How do you structure long-term contracts and investments to ensure supply reliability?

### Phase 4: Debrief and Analysis (Minutes 70-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Vulnerability Assessment:** How did concentrated Chinese control of rare earths create coercive leverage? Could this vulnerability have been reduced earlier?

2. **Resilience vs. Cost:** Domestic rare earth production is 2-3x more expensive than Chinese supply. How do you justify taxpayer and consumer costs for supply security?

3. **Environmental Trade-offs:** Rare earth mining and processing create environmental damage. How did you balance environmental protection against resource security?

4. **Allied Coordination:** Why was allied unity difficult? How could burden-sharing be structured to align incentives?

5. **Retaliation Calculus:** If the U.S. retaliates with its own export controls, does this escalate toward economic decoupling? What are the risks and benefits?

6. **Long-term Strategy:** What mix of stockpiling, diversification, domestic production, recycling, and substitution research is optimal?

7. **Unintended Consequences:**
   - Impact on clean energy transition if rare earths become scarce/expensive
   - Chinese response to U.S. efforts to reduce dependence
   - Environmental and indigenous community impacts of accelerated mining
   - Precedent for future resource weapon ization

8. **China's Perspective:** From Beijing's viewpoint, why use rare earths as leverage? What does this reveal about Chinese strategic thinking?

### Background Materials

**Key Authorities:**
- Defense Production Act, 50 U.S.C. § 4501 et seq.
- Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, 50 U.S.C. § 98 et seq.

## Tabletop Exercise: AI Export Control Dilemma

**Chapter:** 4 - Technology and Innovation Competition

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Analyze effectiveness and limitations of technology export controls
- Evaluate trade-offs between denying adversary capabilities and harming domestic industry
- Understand challenges of controlling dual-use technologies with global development
- Assess allied coordination in multilateral technology restrictions

### Scenario Overview

**Date: September 2027**

A classified intelligence report reveals that China has made breakthrough progress in developing advanced AI models for military applications, including autonomous weapon systems, intelligence analysis, and cyber warfare tools. The AI models rival OpenAI's GPT-5 and Google's Gemini Ultra in capability.

Investigation reveals that Chinese progress was enabled by:
1. Illegally obtained NVIDIA H100 GPUs smuggled through third countries despite export controls
2. Recruitment of Chinese-American AI researchers who worked at U.S. labs
3. Massive government investment in AI supercomputing infrastructure using slightly older but still capable chips
4. Stolen training data and model architectures from U.S. companies via cyber espionage

The Department of Defense warns that Chinese AI-enabled military systems could narrow or eliminate U.S. technological advantage within 2-3 years if current trends continue. However, U.S. AI companies warn that tighter export controls would:
- Eliminate their largest foreign market (China represents 25% of revenue for some firms)
- Slow AI development by reducing scale and investment returns
- Push China toward complete self-reliance, creating competing global AI standards
- Drive talented researchers away from the U.S. if they cannot collaborate globally

You are convened as the Technology Policy Coordination Committee to recommend export control and AI security policies.

### Participant Roles

**Deputy National Security Advisor**
- Responsibilities: Balance security and economic interests, coordinate policy
- Interests: Preventing Chinese military AI advantage, maintaining U.S. technological leadership
- Constraints: Allied support needed for controls to be effective

**Deputy Secretary of Defense**

**Deputy Secretary of Commerce**
- Responsibilities: Export controls (BIS), technology industry competitiveness
- Interests: Effective controls without destroying U.S. industry
- Constraints: Industry opposition, enforcement challenges, allied coordination needed

**Deputy Secretary of State**
- Responsibilities: Allied coordination, multilateral export control regimes
- Interests: Maintaining allied unity, preventing proliferation
- Constraints: Allies have different China exposures and tech industry interests

**CEO of Major AI Company (Private Sector Advisor)**
- Responsibilities: Represent AI industry perspective
- Interests: Maximizing markets and talent access, preventing fragmentation
- Constraints: Shareholder pressure, competition from Chinese AI firms

**FBI Deputy Director**
- Responsibilities: Counterintelligence, technology theft investigations
- Interests: Preventing espionage and illegal technology transfers
- Constraints: Cannot monitor all researchers, legal restrictions on surveillance

### Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Assessment and Options (Minutes 0-20)

**Inject 1: Intelligence Briefing**

The intelligence community reports:
- China's AI progress is 12-18 months behind cutting-edge U.S. models but closing gap rapidly
- Chinese military is integrating AI into command/control, autonomous systems, cyber operations
- Current export controls are being circumvented via Singapore, Malaysia, UAE transshipment
- Over 500 Chinese-origin researchers work at leading U.S. AI labs; some maintain China ties
- Chinese firms are designing AI chips to work around U.S. export restrictions

Technical assessment shows controlling AI requires addressing:
- **Hardware:** Advanced GPUs/AI chips (current export control focus)
- **Software:** AI frameworks, model architectures, training algorithms
- **Data:** Large datasets needed for training
- **Talent:** AI researchers and engineers
- **Cloud computing:** Access to U.S.-based AI training infrastructure

**Key Questions:**
1. What is the primary objective: delay Chinese AI development, deny specific military applications, or maintain U.S. lead?
2. Which elements (hardware, software, data, talent, cloud) should be controlled, and how?
3. How do you prevent circumvention when AI technology is globally distributed?

### Phase 2: Industry and Allied Reactions (Minutes 20-45)

**Inject 2: Industry Pushback**

Major U.S. AI companies present impact analysis:
- **NVIDIA:** Proposes "middle ground" AI chips for export - powerful but limited for military use; warns full ban costs $10 billion annually
- **OpenAI/Anthropic:** Argue controlling model weights is impractical (easily copied); propose verification systems instead
- **Microsoft/Google:** Warn that losing Chinese market funding will slow global AI development; suggest tiered access based on use cases
- **Meta:** Points out open-source AI models cannot be controlled; advocates focusing on downstream military applications only

Industry threatens:
- Lobbying Congress to block stringent controls
- Moving AI development overseas to avoid U.S. restrictions
- Reducing cooperation with government on AI safety research

**Inject 3: Allied Divergence**

- **Netherlands (ASML):** Will not restrict AI chip lithography equipment sales without WTO-consistent controls
- **Taiwan (TSMC):** Caught between U.S. pressure and economic dependence on Chinese market
- **UK/EU:** Developing separate AI governance frameworks; resistant to export controls that harm competitiveness
- **South Korea (Samsung):** Willing to coordinate but requests compensation for lost Chinese sales
- **Japan:** Supports controls but fears driving China toward complete self-reliance

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you address industry concerns while achieving security objectives?
2. What concessions or incentives bring allies into coordinated export control regime?
3. How do you control open-source AI when models and code are freely published?

### Phase 3: Escalation and Strategic Choices (Minutes 45-70)

**Inject 4: Chinese Response**

China announces:
- **Counter-controls:** Export restrictions on AI training data services and labeled datasets
- **Talent restrictions:** Exit bans on Chinese AI researchers; incentives for overseas Chinese researchers to return
- **Alternative ecosystem:** $100 billion fund for indigenous AI development; mandatory use of Chinese AI models for domestic applications
- **Legal retaliation:** Investigations of U.S. AI companies under Anti-Monopoly Law and Data Security Law

Chinese AI development appears to accelerate in response to controls, with government directing unlimited resources toward self-sufficiency.

**Inject 5: Espionage and Enforcement Challenges**

FBI reports:
- Attempted theft of proprietary AI model weights from U.S. company by insider
- Chinese intelligence recruiting AI researchers at academic conferences
- Covert Chinese access to U.S. cloud computing for AI training via shell companies
- Illegal GPU shipments discovered but likely only small fraction of total smuggling

Commerce Department reports export control violations are difficult to prove and prosecute; companies argue they are complying with "letter of law" while finding creative workarounds.

**Decision Required:** Comprehensive AI technology security strategy including:
1. Export control scope (hardware only, or also software/models/cloud access?)
2. Enforcement mechanisms and resources
3. Allied coordination and burden-sharing
4. Researcher mobility and security policies
5. Domestic AI development acceleration programs
6. Offramps and criteria for adjusting controls

**Key Questions:**
1. Do comprehensive controls that harm U.S. industry make America more or less secure in the long run?
2. How do you prevent controls from accelerating Chinese self-reliance rather than creating dependency?
3. What is enforceable given AI's digital, globally distributed nature?
4. Should controls focus on capabilities (all advanced AI) or specific applications (military AI)?

### Phase 4: Debrief and Analysis (Minutes 70-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Effectiveness Assessment:** Can export controls significantly delay Chinese AI development, or do they merely reduce U.S. industry revenue while China achieves self-reliance anyway?

2. **Dual-Use Challenge:** AI is inherently dual-use (civilian and military applications inseparable). How do you control military applications without restricting beneficial civilian innovation?

3. **Industry Incentives:** How did you align profit-seeking private companies with national security objectives? Were carrots (subsidies, market protection) or sticks (mandatory controls) more effective?

4. **Talent and Openness:** The U.S. AI lead depends on attracting global talent and open research collaboration. How do you balance openness with security?

5. **Allied Coordination:** Why is AI export control coordination harder than Cold War-era CoCom? How sustainable is multilateral cooperation when allies have competing interests?

6. **Strategic Logic:**
   - If controls work: Does delaying Chinese AI create window for U.S. to build insurmountable lead?
   - If controls fail: Do they still impose costs on China (slower, more expensive development)?
   - Unintended consequences: Accelerating Chinese AI industry, fragmenting global AI ecosystem

7. **Long-term Vision:** What is the end state - permanent technological bifurcation, temporary delay until negotiated AI arms control, or failed attempt at containment?

8. **Alternative Approaches:** Rather than export controls, should strategy emphasize:
   - Outcompeting through superior investment and innovation
   - International AI safety governance reducing proliferation risks
   - Defensive measures (counterintelligence, securing U.S. models) rather than denying China access

## Tabletop Exercise: Submarine Cable Sabotage and Digital Infrastructure Crisis

**Chapter:** 5 - Information, Standards, and Digital Infrastructure

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Analyze vulnerabilities in global digital infrastructure
- Evaluate information controls as tools of statecraft
- Understand trade-offs between connectivity and security
- Assess attribution challenges and response options to infrastructure attacks

### Scenario Overview

**Date: March 2028**

Multiple submarine fiber-optic cables connecting Taiwan to the global internet are simultaneously damaged in suspected sabotage. The cables, which carry 99% of Taiwan's international data traffic, suffer breaks at different points on the ocean floor. Taiwan's internet connectivity to the outside world drops by 80%.

Initial reports suggest the damage occurred near cable landing stations but deep underwater, making immediate repair impossible. Repair ships will require 4-6 weeks to fix all breaks. Commercial satellite capacity cannot fully compensate for the lost bandwidth.

Intelligence suggests Chinese fishing vessels and a survey ship were operating near the cable routes shortly before the breaks occurred. However, attribution is uncertain - breaks could be sabotage, accidents, or natural causes (underwater landslides, earthquakes).

Taiwan alleges deliberate Chinese sabotage as part of hybrid warfare strategy. China denies involvement and suggests Taiwan is fabricating claims to garner international sympathy. The crisis creates immediate impacts on Taiwan's economy, financial sector, and ability to coordinate with allies.

- Constraints: Regulatory authority limited to U.S. territory

### Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Initial Response (Minutes 0-20)

**Inject 1: Economic and Security Impact**

Within 48 hours of cable damage:
- Taiwan stock exchange trading volume drops 60% (unable to handle international transactions)
- TSMC reports disruptions in coordinating with global customers and suppliers
- Taiwan's banks cannot process international wire transfers reliably
- U.S. companies with operations in Taiwan face communications blackouts
- Taiwan military reports degraded coordination capabilities

Taiwan requests:
1. Emergency satellite communications support
2. U.S. intelligence on who damaged cables
3. International condemnation and investigation
4. Protection for repair ships (fears Chinese interference)

**Key Questions:**
1. Without definitive attribution, what is appropriate U.S. response?
2. Should the U.S. provide military escort for cable repair ships if Taiwan requests?
3. What immediate steps can help Taiwan maintain critical communications?

### Phase 2: Attribution and Chinese Pressure (Minutes 20-45)

**Inject 2: Intelligence Assessment**

- **Possible:** Accidental damage from anchor dragging or fishing gear
- **Unlikely:** Natural causes (no seismic activity)
- **Confidence:** Medium (circumstantial evidence, no smoking gun)

Intelligence also reveals:
- China mapping global submarine cable networks using survey ships
- Chinese firms involved in cable manufacturing and repair (potential access/vulnerability)
- Russia previously conducted cable surveillance operations; potential cooperation with China

**Inject 3: Expanding Targeting**

New reports indicate:
- Undersea cable damage detected between Japan and U.S. (Guam) - minor disruption, suspicious timing
- Increased Chinese drone and surface vessel activity near cable routes in South China Sea
- Chinese state media publishes articles on "cable vulnerabilities" and how fragile global connectivity is

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman suggests Taiwan "provoked this crisis with reckless separatist rhetoric" and should bear consequences.

**Key Questions:**
1. At what point does cable sabotage constitute an act of war or trigger mutual defense obligations?
2. How do you deter future attacks when attribution is difficult to prove publicly?
3. Should the U.S. issue public warnings to China despite attribution uncertainty?

### Phase 3: Strategic Response and Escalation Control (Minutes 45-70)

**Inject 4: Escalation Options**

Military proposes:
- Increased naval patrols near critical cable routes
- Classified retaliatory cyber operations against Chinese infrastructure
- Public designation of cable sabotage as "armed attack" triggering Taiwan Relations Act obligations

State Department proposes:
- International investigation through UN or specialized agency
- Coalition statement condemning infrastructure attacks

Taiwan urges strong response, warning that cable attacks are "testing" for broader infrastructure campaign or blockade.

**Inject 5: Collateral Damage**

The cable damage has global ripple effects:
- Internet latency increases across Asia-Pacific region
- Some cryptocurrency trading platforms experience disruptions
- Cloud services routing through Taiwan face degraded performance
- Several Southeast Asian countries experience partial outages

Countries with Chinese cable investments (Pakistan, Myanmar, several African nations) experience no disruptions, raising questions about whether they would be targeted or leverage.

**Decision Required:**
1. Public attribution and messaging strategy
2. Military, diplomatic, and economic response measures
3. Protection for cable repair operations and future infrastructure
4. Long-term cable security strategy
5. Deterrence strategy for future infrastructure attacks

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you respond to infrastructure attacks that fall below traditional "armed attack" threshold?
2. Should the U.S. establish "red lines" for critical infrastructure attacks?
3. How do you build resilient communications that cannot be disrupted by cable sabotage?
4. What is appropriate retaliation: cyber operations against Chinese infrastructure, economic sanctions, military posturing?

### Phase 4: Debrief (Minutes 70-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Infrastructure Vulnerability:** Why are submarine cables such attractive targets? What makes defending them difficult?

2. **Attribution Challenge:** How did uncertainty about who caused damage affect response options? What evidence would be sufficient for strong response?

3. **Escalation Control:** How do you respond forcefully without triggering military escalation or cyber warfare spiral?

4. **Gray Zone Conflict:** Infrastructure sabotage sits between peace and war. What frameworks should govern responses?

5. **Resilience vs. Deterrence:** Should strategy emphasize deterring attacks (threats of retaliation) or building resilience (redundancy, diversity)?

6. **International Cooperation:** How can international law and norms better protect critical infrastructure?

7. **Second-Order Effects:**
   - Impact on Taiwan's economic viability and security
   - Precedent for infrastructure attacks in future conflicts

**Key Questions:**
1. Should the U.S. escalate with additional tariffs, hold position, or seek de-escalation?
2. How do you compensate domestic constituencies (farmers, manufacturers) hurt by retaliation?
3. What are realistic objectives: forced Chinese concessions, reduced bilateral trade dependence, or symbolic demonstration of resolve?

### Phase 2: Allied Pressure and Third-Party Effects (Minutes 20-45)

**Inject 2: Allied Concerns**

- **EU:** Complains U.S. tariffs violate WTO rules; threatens counter-tariffs if U.S. doesn't exempt European goods
- **Japan/South Korea:** Warn that their firms caught in supply chain crossfire will be disadvantaged versus Chinese competitors
- **ASEAN countries:** Fear becoming pressure points as both U.S. and China seek alternative trade routes through Southeast Asia
- **Taiwan:** Concerned that U.S.-China trade war reduces Taiwanese leverage and economic importance

**Inject 3: Chinese Economic Warfare**

Beyond tariffs, China implements:
- Informal import bans on U.S. goods (customs delays, regulatory harassment)
- Investigations and fines against U.S. companies operating in China (Apple, Tesla, Microsoft face "anti-monopoly" actions)
- "Unreliable Entity List" designating U.S. firms for restrictions
- Encouragement of consumer boycotts against U.S. brands

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you coordinate with allies to create united front versus allowing each country to cut separate deals with China?
2. Should U.S. respond to Chinese non-tariff barriers with its own informal restrictions?
3. What is the appropriate forum: bilateral negotiations, WTO dispute settlement, or plurilateral coalition?

### Phase 3: Escalation or De-escalation (Minutes 45-70)

**Inject 4: Domestic Political Pressure**

- **Farm state senators:** Demand emergency agricultural subsidies and threaten to block administration priorities
- **Manufacturing CEOs:** Split between those benefiting from protection and those hurt by supply chain disruptions
- **Consumer groups:** Protest rising prices and inflation
- **Labor unions:** Support tariffs on Chinese goods but oppose automation that tariffs might accelerate
- **Congressional leadership:** Demands trade deal before midterm elections

**Inject 5: Chinese Offer**

Through back channels, China signals willingness to negotiate if:
1. U.S. removes Section 301 tariffs
2. U.S. ends semiconductor export controls
3. U.S. stops arms sales to Taiwan

Short of these demands, China offers modest concessions:
- Increased purchases of U.S. agricultural products ($20 billion annually)
- Slight reduction in Chinese tariffs (from 50% to 30% on some goods)
- Vague commitments on intellectual property protection

**Decision Required:**
1. Next steps in tariff policy (escalate, hold, or reduce)
2. Compensation programs for affected U.S. industries
3. Allied coordination strategy
4. Negotiation approach with China
5. Long-term trade policy toward China (managed decoupling, phase agreement, or full normalization)

**Key Questions:**
1. Are tariffs achieving stated objectives (changing Chinese behavior, protecting U.S. industry)?
2. How much economic pain is acceptable to achieve trade policy goals?
3. What would constitute a "win" that justifies declaring success and de-escalating?

### Phase 4: Debrief (Minutes 70-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Effectiveness:** Did tariffs effectively coerce China or primarily impose mutual costs?
2. **Escalation Dynamics:** What drove escalation? Could spiral have been prevented?
3. **Domestic Politics:** How did interest group politics shape trade policy options?
4. **Allied Coordination:** Why is unified Western trade policy difficult to achieve?
5. **Alternatives:** Could negotiation, multilateral pressure, or targeted sectoral approaches achieve better outcomes?
6. **Long-term Impacts:** Effects on U.S.-China economic relationship, global trade system, WTO legitimacy?

### Background Materials

**Authorities:**
- Section 301 of Trade Act of 1974
- Section 232 (national security tariffs)
- International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)

**Data:**
- U.S.-China trade: $700 billion annually
- U.S. agricultural exports to China: $20-30 billion
- Tariff revenue vs. economic costs
- Historical trade war precedents (Smoot-Hawley, 1930s)

**Precedents:**
- 2018-2020 U.S.-China trade war
- Phase One trade agreement (2020)
- Trump/Biden tariff policies

### Learning Outcomes

1. Analyze escalation dynamics in trade conflicts
2. Evaluate tariff effectiveness as coercive tool
3. Navigate domestic political economy of trade policy
4. Understand limitations of unilateral trade measures

## Tabletop Exercise: Designing a Comprehensive Financial Sanctions Regime

**Chapter:** 7 - Financial Statecraft and Sanctions

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Design effective financial sanctions packages balancing leverage and costs
- Evaluate trade-offs between comprehensive sanctions and targeted measures
- Understand challenges of sanctions enforcement and evasion
- Assess de-dollarization risks from aggressive sanctions use

### Scenario Overview

**Date: April 2028**

The military junta in Myanmar, which has ruled since the 2021 coup, intensifies its brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, ethnic minorities, and civil society. Reports document:
- Mass killings of civilians by security forces
- Widespread use of torture and arbitrary detention
- Forced displacement of 500,000+ Rohingya and ethnic minorities
- Blocking humanitarian aid access to conflict zones
- Attacks on schools, hospitals, and religious sites

International outrage grows following leaked videos of atrocities. Congress passes bipartisan legislation demanding the Administration impose "comprehensive sanctions" on Myanmar's military regime. Regional allies (India, Thailand, Japan) express concern about refugee flows and regional instability but are reluctant to isolate Myanmar, which could drive it deeper into Chinese orbit.

You are convened as the Sanctions Policy Coordination Committee to design a financial sanctions package that maximizes pressure on the junta while managing humanitarian, economic, and geopolitical complications.

### Participant Roles

**Deputy Secretary of Treasury**
- Responsibilities: OFAC sanctions, financial system stability
- Interests: Effective pressure on junta, protecting dollar system integrity
- Constraints: De-dollarization concerns, enforcement challenges

**Deputy Secretary of State**
- Responsibilities: Diplomatic pressure, humanitarian concerns, regional stability
- Interests: Supporting democracy, protecting civilians, allied coordination
- Constraints: Regional allies resistant to sanctions, Chinese influence

**Deputy National Security Advisor**
- Responsibilities: Balancing competing interests, strategic objectives
- Interests: Preventing Chinese domination of Myanmar, promoting democratic norms
- Constraints: Limited leverage over military junta, regional complexity

**USAID Administrator**
- Responsibilities: Humanitarian assistance, development programs
- Interests: Maintaining access to vulnerable populations
- Constraints: Sanctions can block humanitarian aid flows

**NSC Director for Asia**
- Responsibilities: Regional strategy, managing China factor
- Interests: Preventing Myanmar becoming Chinese client state
- Constraints: Sanctions may push junta toward Beijing

**NGO Human Rights Advocate**
- Responsibilities: Represent civil society and democracy activists
- Interests: Maximum pressure on junta, accountability for atrocities
- Constraints: No formal authority, limited information

### Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Sanctions Design (Minutes 0-20)

**Inject 1: Sanctions Menu**

Treasury presents options:
1. **Comprehensive/Country-Level:** Block all financial transactions with Myanmar (similar to North Korea/Iran)
2. **Sectoral:** Target specific industries (natural gas, jade, gemstones generating junta revenue)
3. **Targeted/Individual:** Sanction specific junta leaders, military units, businesses
4. **Financial Institution:** Block Myanmar banks from dollar system, SWIFT access
5. **Secondary:** Sanction third parties doing business with Myanmar junta

For each option, assessment provided:
- Estimated impact on junta revenue and behavior
- Humanitarian costs (blocking food, medicine, banking for civilians)
- Enforcement challenges (evasion through China, Thailand)
- Allied coordination needs
- De-dollarization risks (driving countries toward alternative payment systems)

**Key Questions:**
1. What is the primary objective: compel junta to negotiate power transfer, punish atrocities, or degrade military capabilities?
2. How do you maximize pressure on junta while minimizing humanitarian harm to civilian population?
3. Which sanctions approach (comprehensive, sectoral, targeted) best balances effectiveness and costs?

### Phase 2: Enforcement and Evasion (Minutes 20-45)

**Inject 2: Evasion Routes**

Intelligence reveals:
- **China:** Providing financial lifeline through yuan-denominated trade, alternative payment systems (CIPS)
- **Thailand:** Thai banks facilitating transactions despite U.S. pressure; cross-border informal finance
- **Singapore:** Shell companies obscuring beneficial ownership of Myanmar businesses
- **Cryptocurrency:** Junta leaders using crypto to move funds and evade detection
- **Hawala networks:** Informal value transfer systems bypassing formal banking

Enforcement challenges:
- Limited Treasury/DoJ resources to investigate complex evasion schemes
- Difficulty distinguishing legitimate humanitarian transactions from sanctions violations
- Third-country resistance to enforcing U.S. sanctions

**Inject 3: Humanitarian Impact**

USAID and NGOs report sanctions side effects:
- Banks refusing all Myanmar transactions due to over-compliance (de-risking)
- Humanitarian organizations cannot pay staff or purchase supplies
- Remittances from migrant workers (critical for families) blocked
- Medical supply imports disrupted
- Food prices spiking due to import financing difficulties

Democracy activists inside Myanmar send message: "We support sanctions on junta, but please don't starve the population."

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you design humanitarian exemptions that allow aid while preventing junta exploitation?
2. Should U.S. use secondary sanctions to compel third-party compliance, even if it damages relationships?
3. What enforcement resources and mechanisms are needed to make sanctions effective?

### Phase 3: Strategic Trade-offs and Geopolitical Complications (Minutes 45-70)

**Inject 4: Chinese Counter-Moves**

China responds to U.S. sanctions by:
- Increasing economic engagement with Myanmar ($10 billion investment package)
- Offering Myanmar access to Chinese alternative payment systems
- Proposing "Myanmar peace process" that would legitimize junta while marginalizing democracy opposition
- Using Myanmar as example in international fora of "U.S. unilateral coercion" and why countries need alternatives to dollar system

**Inject 5: Regional Allies Pushback**

- **India:** Concerned about Chinese influence; quietly engaging with junta; opposes sanctions that empower Beijing
- **Thailand:** Hosts 100,000 Myanmar refugees; fears sanctions will increase flows; resists enforcement cooperation
- **Japan:** Supports democracy rhetorically but has business interests in Myanmar; prefers engagement to sanctions
- **ASEAN:** Divided; some members support sanctions, others prioritize non-interference principle

Allies request U.S. provide:
- Funding for refugee support if sanctions increase displacement
- Alternative economic engagement plans if they comply with sanctions
- Coordination on "carrots" for junta (sanctions relief conditions)

**Decision Required:** Final sanctions package including:
1. Scope (comprehensive, sectoral, or targeted)
2. Humanitarian exemption mechanisms
3. Secondary sanctions on third parties
4. Enforcement strategy and resources
5. Allied coordination and burden-sharing
6. Conditionality (clear criteria for sanctions relief)
7. Accompanying diplomatic and economic measures

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you prevent sanctions from driving Myanmar further into Chinese sphere?
2. Are sanctions sustainable if regional allies don't cooperate and China provides alternatives?
3. What combination of pressure (sanctions) and incentives (sanctions relief, aid) creates path to resolution?
4. How do you manage risk that aggressive sanctions use accelerates global de-dollarization?

### Phase 4: Debrief (Minutes 70-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Effectiveness:** Can financial sanctions compel behavior change by determined autocratic regime?
2. **Humanitarian Balance:** How did you navigate tension between pressure and humanitarian protection?
3. **Enforcement:** What makes sanctions enforceable versus easily evaded?
4. **Allied Coordination:** Why is multilateral cooperation difficult even when allies share values?
5. **Unintended Consequences:** De-dollarization, Chinese influence, civilian suffering, NGO de-banking
6. **Long-term Strategy:** Exit strategy? Conditions for lifting sanctions? How to avoid permanent isolation?

### Background Materials

**Authorities:**
- International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)
- Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act
- Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA)

**Data:**
- Myanmar military revenue sources (natural gas, gems, timber, banking)

- Constraints: Blocking deals creates diplomatic friction

### Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Case 1 - Semiconductor Equipment (Minutes 0-25)

**Inject 1: Transaction Details**

Chinese firm "TechPrecision Industries" offers $800 million for 40% stake in "AmeriMachine Inc." (based in California, 500 employees). AmeriMachine produces ultra-precision CNC machines used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

**Due Diligence Findings:**
- TechPrecision has contracts with Chinese government entities
- AmeriMachine technology is dual-use (also used in aerospace, defense)
- Several AmeriMachine executives are former DOD contractors
- Chinese investors would gain board seats and access to R&D
- No direct U.S. government contracts, but supplies companies that have them

**Intelligence Assessment:**
- TechPrecision likely has ties to Chinese military-civil fusion programs
- Technology could enhance Chinese semiconductor manufacturing capabilities
- Risk of technology diversion to Chinese military applications

**Economic Impact:**
- AmeriMachine struggling financially; needs capital injection
- Alternative investors (U.S., EU, Japan) offering less money with more conditions
- 500 jobs at risk if company cannot secure financing

**Industry Position:**
- U.S. semiconductor firms oppose (fear strengthening Chinese capabilities)
- Some equipment manufacturers support (want access to Chinese market)

**Key Questions:**
1. Does this transaction present unacceptable national security risk?
2. Are mitigation measures (e.g., board restrictions, technology access limits, compliance monitoring) sufficient?
3. How do you balance AmeriMachine's financial needs against technology protection?

### Phase 2: Case 2 - Agricultural Biotechnology (Minutes 25-50)

**Inject 2: Transaction Details**

Chinese private equity fund "Golden Harvest Capital" proposes $2 billion investment in "GenAg Sciences" (based in Iowa), acquiring 35% stake. GenAg develops CRISPR gene-editing technology for crop improvement.

**Due Diligence Findings:**
- Golden Harvest's largest investors include Chinese state-owned enterprises
- GenAg technology has applications for food security (China's concern)
- Technology could enhance biological research capabilities
- GenAg holds sensitive genomic data from U.S. agricultural regions
- Chinese investors request rights to license technology in Asia

**Intelligence Assessment:**
- China prioritizes agricultural biotechnology for food security
- Potential dual-use for biological weapons research (low probability but catastrophic impact)
- Concern about Chinese access to U.S. genomic and agricultural data
- China's military-civil fusion could redirect civilian technology

**Economic Impact:**
- GenAg needs capital for R&D and commercialization
- Investment would accelerate development of drought-resistant crops (beneficial globally)
- Iowa governor and Congressional delegation strongly support (jobs, rural development)
- U.S. agricultural sector split (some fear Chinese biotech dominance)

**Political Pressure:**
- Senator from Iowa threatens to block administration nominees if deal blocked
- Bioethics community concerned about genomic data transfers
- Farm lobby supports investment as opening Chinese market access

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you assess dual-use risks of biotechnology versus traditional defense technology?
2. Should genomic data and agricultural IP be treated as national security assets?
3. Are concerns about Chinese food security motivations legitimate or cover for military applications?

### Phase 3: Case 3 - EV Battery Manufacturing (Minutes 50-75)

**Inject 3: Transaction Details**

"ChargeTech Industries" (Chinese battery manufacturer) proposes $5 billion greenfield investment building EV battery gigafactory in Detroit area. No U.S. company acquisition; purely new facility construction.

**Due Diligence Findings:**
- ChargeTech is private company but receives Chinese government subsidies
- Facility would produce batteries for U.S. automakers (Tesla, Ford, GM)
- Technology involves proprietary Chinese battery chemistry and manufacturing processes
- Plant would employ 2,000 workers in economically distressed region
- Chinese firm requests access to U.S. grid infrastructure and rare earth supply chains

**Intelligence Assessment:**
- Minimal direct national security risk (consumer EV batteries)
- Potential supply chain dependencies if future U.S. automakers rely on Chinese supplier
- Facility could collect data on U.S. energy infrastructure and logistics
- China could use facility as leverage in future crises (threaten shutdown)

**Economic Impact:**
- Massive economic benefit to Detroit region ($5 billion investment, 2,000 direct jobs, 5,000+ indirect)
- Accelerates U.S. EV transition (climate benefits)
- Reduces need to import Chinese batteries
- But creates dependency on Chinese firm for critical U.S. industry

**Political Pressure:**
- Michigan governor and Congressional delegation demand approval
- Labor unions support (jobs)
- Environmental groups support (EV transition)
- Some manufacturing groups oppose (subsidized Chinese competition)
- Energy Department concerned about grid infrastructure access

**Key Questions:**
1. Does greenfield investment (new facility, not acquisition) present different security risks?
2. How do you weigh job creation and climate benefits against supply chain dependency risks?
3. Can mitigation measures (e.g., restricting infrastructure access, requiring U.S. sourcing) address concerns?

### Phase 4: Synthesis and Recommendations (Minutes 75-90)

**Decision Required:** For each case, recommend:
1. Approve
2. Approve with mitigation measures (specify)
3. Block/divest

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Risk Assessment Framework:** How did you distinguish acceptable from unacceptable national security risks across different sectors?

2. **Mitigation Effectiveness:** When are mitigation measures sufficient versus inadequate? How enforceable are they?

3. **Economic Trade-offs:** How did you balance security risks against economic benefits (jobs, capital, innovation)?

4. **Political Pressure:** How did you handle Congressional and state-level pressure? Should CFIUS be insulated from politics?

5. **Consistency:** Were your decisions consistent across the three cases? What principles guided trade-offs?

6. **Sectoral Differences:** Should some sectors (semiconductors, biotech, energy) receive different scrutiny levels?

7. **Alternatives to Blocking:**
   - Could U.S. provide alternative financing to reduce Chinese investment need?
   - Are there coalition investment models (allies pool capital) to replace Chinese investors?

8. **Long-term Strategy:** Impact on U.S. as investment destination? Will aggressive screening drive capital elsewhere?

### Background Materials

**Key Authorities:**
- Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA), 2018
- CFIUS regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 800
- Export Control Reform Act (ECRA) for technology controls

**CFIUS Process:**

## Tabletop Exercise: Applying Historical Lessons to Contemporary Challenges

**Chapter:** 9 - Historical and Comparative Cases

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Extract generalizable lessons from historical sanctions cases
- Compare effectiveness factors across different eras and contexts
- Apply historical frameworks to contemporary policy challenges
- Understand limitations of historical analogies

### Scenario Overview

**Date: May 2028**

Following a military coup in a strategically located country (fictional "Meridiana"), the National Security Council must design a coercive economic strategy. You are tasked with applying lessons from three historical cases to inform your recommendations:

1. **CoCom (1949-1994):** Multilateral technology denial against Soviet bloc
2. **South African Apartheid Sanctions (1960s-1994):** Comprehensive sanctions contributing to regime change
3. **Cuba Embargo (1960-present):** Long-running unilateral sanctions with limited effectiveness

**Current Crisis:** Meridiana's military has overthrown democratically elected government, arrested opposition leaders, and declared martial law. The country sits at a critical geographic chokepoint for energy transit and hosts significant rare earth deposits. Both China and Russia have economic interests in Meridiana and are offering financial support to the junta.

### Participant Roles

**Deputy Secretary of State (Historical Case 1: CoCom Expert)**
- Assigned to present CoCom lessons: multilateral coordination, technology denial effectiveness, allied burden-sharing

**Deputy Secretary of Treasury (Historical Case 2: South Africa Expert)**
- Assigned to present South Africa lessons: comprehensive sanctions, corporate divestment, role of domestic opposition

**Deputy National Security Advisor (Historical Case 3: Cuba Expert)**
- Assigned to present Cuba lessons: unilateral sanctions limitations, regime resilience, humanitarian costs

**Policy Planning Staff Director**
- Synthesize lessons across cases and identify relevant applications

**Intelligence Officer**
- Provide current intelligence on Meridiana situation

**Academic Historian (External Advisor)**
- Challenge assumptions and highlight where historical analogies may mislead

### Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Historical Case Presentations (Minutes 0-30)

**Inject 1: CoCom Case (10 minutes)**

Presenter covers:
- **Structure:** NATO allies plus Japan coordinated export controls on strategic technologies to Soviet bloc
- **Effectiveness:** Successfully degraded Soviet military-industrial capabilities; forced costly indigenous development
- **Keys to success:** (1) Allied unity based on shared Soviet threat, (2) Clear technology lists, (3) Long time horizon (40+ years), (4) Soviet relative economic isolation
- **Limitations:** Required constant diplomatic maintenance; allies cheated; Soviet eventually developed alternatives

**Lessons for Meridiana:**
- Multilateral cooperation multiplies effectiveness but is hard to achieve/sustain
- Technology denial works if target cannot easily substitute
- Requires long-term commitment measured in decades, not years

**Inject 2: South Africa Apartheid Sanctions (10 minutes)**

Presenter covers:
- **Evolution:** Gradual escalation from arms embargo (1960s/70s) to comprehensive sanctions (1980s)
- **Mechanisms:** UN sanctions, corporate divestment, capital flight, cultural/sports boycotts, oil embargo
- **Effectiveness:** Contributed to regime change (1994) but not sole factor; domestic resistance critical
- **Keys to success:** (1) Global moral consensus against apartheid, (2) South African business community support for change, (3) Internal resistance (ANC, labor), (4) Security deterioration
- **Limitations:** Sanctions alone insufficient; required combination with internal pressure

**Lessons for Meridiana:**
- Comprehensive sanctions can work but require moral legitimacy and internal opposition partners
- Corporate and financial sector pressure can be powerful
- Humanitarian costs of comprehensive sanctions are significant
- Multilateral legitimacy (UN) matters

**Inject 3: Cuba Embargo (10 minutes)**

Presenter covers:
- **Structure:** U.S. unilateral comprehensive embargo (1960-present)
- **Objectives:** Initially regime change; later deterrence of Latin American communism; eventually normalized as policy inertia
- **Effectiveness:** Failed to achieve regime change despite 60+ years; regime adapted and survived
- **Why it failed:** (1) Unilateral (other countries traded with Cuba), (2) Soviet support until 1991, (3) Regime maintained domestic control, (4) Nationalism ("resistance to imperialism") legitimized regime
- **Costs:** Humanitarian suffering; U.S. isolation in hemisphere; entrenched Castro regime

**Lessons for Meridiana:**
- Unilateral sanctions against regime with external support rarely succeed
- Long-term sanctions can entrench target regime and rally nationalist support
- Clear exit criteria essential to avoid policy inertia
- Humanitarian exemptions critical

### Phase 2: Analyzing Meridiana (Minutes 30-55)

**Inject 4: Current Intelligence Assessment**

**Meridiana Profile:**
- Population: 30 million
- Economy: Middle-income, dependent on energy transit fees and rare earth exports
- Government: Military junta following coup; popular protests suppressed
- External support: China offering $5 billion loan; Russia providing military equipment
- Opposition: Fragmented; democratic forces arrested; limited organized resistance
- Humanitarian: Food/medicine imports needed; drought threatening famine
- Allies: Regional neighbors divided; some support junta (fear instability), others support democracy

**U.S. Interests:**
- Energy security (30% of Asian LNG transits through Meridiana straits)
- Rare earth access (Meridiana has 20% of global deposits)
- Democratic norms and credibility
- Preventing Chinese/Russian sphere of influence expansion

**Constraints:**
- Limited U.S. trade with Meridiana ($2 billion annually)
- European allies dependent on energy transit
- China and Russia willing to provide economic lifeline
- Regional allies fear refugee flows if sanctions cause collapse

**Key Questions:**
1. Which historical case is most analogous to Meridiana? Why?
2. What contextual differences make historical lessons less applicable?
3. Which success factors from historical cases are present/absent in Meridiana?

### Phase 3: Strategy Design (Minutes 55-80)

**Inject 5: Policy Options**

Participants must design sanctions strategy addressing:

**Objectives Clarity:**
- What is achievable goal: regime change, policy change, containment, or signaling?
- What would constitute success allowing sanctions to be lifted?

**Sanctions Scope:**
- Comprehensive (all trade/finance) or targeted (specific sectors/individuals)?
- Unilateral U.S. or multilateral coalition?
- Which sectors to target: energy transit, rare earths, banking, military?

**Allied Coordination:**
- How to secure European participation despite energy dependencies?
- What incentives/burden-sharing needed?
- UN sanctions (unlikely given Chinese/Russian veto) or coalition of willing?

**Timeline and Sustainability:**
- Short-term pressure (months) or long-term strategy (years/decades)?
- How to sustain domestic and allied support over time?

**Combination with Other Tools:**
- Support for internal opposition (lessons from South Africa)?
- Diplomatic isolation and legitimacy-building?
- Humanitarian exemptions and monitoring?

**Exit Strategy:**
- What junta actions trigger sanctions relief?
- How to avoid Cuba scenario of perpetual sanctions?

**Key Questions:**
1. Based on historical lessons, which approach has best chance of success?
2. How do you adapt historical lessons to different contemporary context?
3. What are realistic objectives given Meridiana's external support and U.S. limited leverage?

### Phase 4: Debrief and Meta-Analysis (Minutes 80-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Analogy Limits:** When are historical analogies helpful versus misleading? What makes Meridiana different from CoCom-era Soviet Union, apartheid South Africa, or Castro's Cuba?

2. **Success Factors:** Across historical cases, what factors correlate with sanctions effectiveness:
   - Multilateral coordination?
   - Target isolation vs. external support?
   - Internal opposition strength?
   - Moral legitimacy?
   - Time horizon?
   - Economic integration level?

3. **Failure Patterns:** Why do sanctions fail:
   - Circumvention by third parties?
   - Target regime resilience?
   - Humanitarian costs undermining support?
   - Policy inertia replacing strategic logic?

4. **Contemporary Differences:** How does 21st century globalization, digital connectivity, and Chinese alternative financing change sanctions effectiveness compared to Cold War era?

5. **Learning Correctly:** What biases affect historical lesson-drawing:
   - Selection bias (studying successful cases, ignoring failures)?
   - Overgeneralization (assuming one context applies to all)?
   - Recency bias (overweighting recent cases)?

6. **Policy Implications:** Should U.S. rely less on economic coercion given historical mixed record? Or can design improvements increase effectiveness?

## Tabletop Exercise: Multi-Domain Crisis in 2030

**Chapter:** 10 - Future Scenarios and Policy Implications

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Anticipate emerging forms of economic coercion using future technologies
- Manage simultaneous crises across multiple domains (cyber, space, economic, climate)
- Evaluate novel policy tools for 21st century geoeconomic competition
- Assess systemic risks and cascade effects in interconnected global systems

### Scenario Overview

**Date: June 2030**

The United States faces an unprecedented multi-domain crisis as tensions with China escalate across economic, technological, and environmental spheres. Unlike historical crises centered on single events or domains, this challenge involves simultaneous pressure across interconnected systems, creating cascading risks and novel policy dilemmas.

The crisis unfolds across five interrelated dimensions:
1. **Climate:** Extreme weather disrupts critical supply chains
2. **Digital:** Cyber attacks target economic infrastructure
3. **Space:** Anti-satellite weapons threaten GPS and communications
4. **Financial:** Digital currency warfare and payment system fragmentation
5. **Biotech:** Synthetic biology enabling new forms of coercion

You are convened as the Strategic Competition Policy Committee to manage escalating tensions and develop integrated response strategies for 21st century economic statecraft.

### Participant Roles

**Deputy National Security Advisor**
- Responsibilities: Coordinate across domains, manage escalation
- Interests: Preventing conflict, protecting U.S. interests
- Constraints: Novel threats exceed existing policy frameworks

**Deputy Secretary of Treasury (Digital Currency Lead)**
- Responsibilities: Financial system stability, digital currency policy
- Interests: Preserving dollar dominance, preventing financial system fragmentation
- Constraints: Limited control over decentralized technologies

**Deputy Secretary of Commerce (Technology Security Lead)**
- Responsibilities: Emerging technology controls, space commerce
- Interests: U.S. technological leadership
- Constraints: Rapid technology change outpaces regulatory frameworks

**CISA Director (Infrastructure Lead)**
- Responsibilities: Critical infrastructure protection across cyber-physical systems
- Interests: Resilience of interconnected systems
- Constraints: Public-private sector coordination challenges

**Space Force Representative**
- Responsibilities: Space domain awareness and security
- Interests: Protecting critical space infrastructure
- Constraints: Limited international norms for space conflict

**Climate Envoy**
- Responsibilities: Climate policy, green technology supply chains
- Interests: Climate transition while protecting security
- Constraints: Climate cooperation needs compete with strategic rivalry

### Timeline and Injects

### Phase 1: Climate-Supply Chain Nexus (Minutes 0-20)

**Inject 1: Green Technology Chokepoint**

Catastrophic flooding in southern China (climate change-amplified typhoon) damages critical infrastructure for:
- 60% of global solar panel production (primarily Xinjiang region)
- 70% of rare earth processing facilities
- Major EV battery component manufacturing

Global green energy transition suddenly faces 12-18 month delays. Prices for solar panels, batteries, and critical minerals spike 300-400%.

**Chinese Response:**
China announces "Climate Emergency Resource Allocation System":
- Prioritizes clean energy exports to "climate cooperation partners"
- Countries supporting U.S. climate technology export controls to China face reduced access
- Offers climate finance and technology access in exchange for diplomatic concessions on Taiwan, South China Sea

**Complicated Dynamics:**
- U.S. needs Chinese green technology for climate targets
- China uses climate emergency to gain geopolitical leverage
- Global South countries caught between U.S. and Chinese climate offers

**Key Questions:**
1. Should climate cooperation be conditioned on Chinese political behavior, or are climate stakes too high?
2. How do you build alternative green technology supply chains when China dominates and climate timeline is urgent?
3. Can the U.S. use climate finance and technology sharing as counter-coercion tool?

### Phase 2: Digital Currency Warfare (Minutes 20-40)

**Inject 2: Payment System Fragmentation**

China accelerates digital yuan internationalization following coordination with Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia:
- **BRICS+ Digital Currency Network:** New payment system for 40+ countries (40% global GDP)
- **Commodity-backed settlement:** Oil, gas, minerals priced in digital currency basket
- **Alternative to SWIFT:** Real-time cross-border payments bypassing dollar system

Simultaneously:
- Several countries announce plans to hold digital yuan reserves
- China offers preferential trade financing for digital yuan users
- Crypto-based payment systems gain traction for sanctions evasion

**U.S. Financial System Impact:**
- Dollar's share of global reserves declines from 58% to 50% in six months
- Treasury market volatility as foreign holdings decline
- Reduced effectiveness of financial sanctions as alternatives proliferate

**Fed and Treasury Assessment:**
- U.S. digital dollar 2+ years from implementation
- Banning competing digital currencies likely drives them underground
- Financial sanctions losing potency as alternative systems mature

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you respond to emerging payment system competition: accelerate U.S. digital dollar, restrict alternatives, or accept multipolar financial system?
2. Can financial sanctions remain effective when targets have viable alternatives?
3. Should U.S. prioritize preserving dollar dominance or gracefully manage transition to multipolar system?

### Phase 3: Cyber-Physical Systems Attack (Minutes 40-60)

**Inject 3: Infrastructure Cascade**

A sophisticated cyber attack (attribution unclear but suspected Chinese origin) targets U.S. critical infrastructure:
- **Power Grid:** Malware disrupts renewable energy systems (solar, wind) causing grid instability
- **Logistics:** Port automation systems compromised; cargo routing chaos
- **Financial:** Clearing systems for equities and derivatives experience delays
- **Telecommunications:** 5G networks experience intermittent outages

Attack exploits vulnerabilities in:
- Internet of Things (IoT) devices manufactured in China
- Software supply chains with compromised open-source components
- AI-powered infrastructure management systems

**Cascading Effects:**
- Economic losses: $50 billion+ in first week
- Public panic: Bank runs, hoarding behavior
- Political pressure: Demands for retaliation

**Attribution Challenge:**
- Attack routed through multiple countries
- Malware includes code fragments from multiple sources
- China denies involvement; suggests "criminal actors"
- No definitive proof of state sponsorship

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you respond to catastrophic cyber attack without certain attribution?
2. What constitutes proportional cyber retaliation, and what escalation risks does it create?
3. How do you secure cyber-physical infrastructure when supply chains are globally interdependent?

### Phase 4: Space and Biotech Dimensions (Minutes 60-80)

**Inject 4: Anti-Satellite Demonstration**

China conducts "debris removal test" using anti-satellite capability, destroying defunct satellite near U.S. GPS constellation. While technically targeting space junk, the demonstration:
- Proves Chinese capability to disable U.S. space infrastructure
- Creates debris field threatening commercial satellites
- Sends message: "Your precision-guided weapons, financial systems, and communications depend on space assets we can threaten"

Simultaneously, Chinese space station begins commercial operations offering:
- Manufacturing in zero-gravity (advanced materials)
- Earth observation services competing with U.S. commercial satellites
- Space-based solar power research (potential energy revolution)

**Inject 5: Synthetic Biology Leverage**

Intelligence reveals Chinese biotech advances:
- CRISPR-based agricultural technology creating drought/pest-resistant crops
- Synthetic biology for rare molecule production (pharmaceutical precursors, industrial chemicals)
- Genetic database containing genomic information on billions of individuals

China offers:
- Agricultural technology to climate-vulnerable countries (creating dependencies)
- Pharmaceutical precursor access based on political alignment
- Genomic research collaboration (with data sharing requirements)

**Strategic Implications:**
- Biotech creates novel forms of leverage (food security, medicine access, genetic information)
- Space denial capabilities threaten entire infrastructure domains
- U.S. lacks comparable biotech leverage or space resilience

**Decision Required:** Integrated strategy addressing:
1. **Immediate crisis management:** Cyber response, infrastructure resilience, market stabilization
2. **Domain-specific strategies:** Climate/green tech, digital currency, cyber security, space, biotech
3. **Cross-cutting approaches:** Supply chain resilience, technology controls, allied coordination
4. **Escalation management:** Preventing crisis spiral across multiple domains simultaneously
5. **Long-term adaptation:** How to compete in multi-domain strategic environment

**Key Questions:**
1. How do you prioritize when crises span multiple domains simultaneously?
2. What new policy tools are needed for emerging technologies (digital currency, synthetic biology, space commerce)?
3. How do you build resilience against novel coercion forms you haven't encountered before?
4. Can traditional frameworks (sanctions, export controls) adapt to decentralized, rapidly evolving technologies?

### Phase 5: Debrief and Future Policy (Minutes 80-90)

**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Multi-Domain Complexity:** How did simultaneous crises across domains complicate decision-making? What coordination mechanisms are needed?

2. **Novel Coercion Forms:** Which emerging technologies (digital currency, synthetic biology, space, AI, quantum) create new coercion opportunities? How do you defend against threats you've never faced?

3. **Interconnection Vulnerabilities:** How do cascading effects across interconnected systems (cyber-physical, climate-economic, space-terrestrial) create systemic risks?

4. **Policy Tool Adequacy:** Are existing tools (sanctions, export controls, investment screening) sufficient for future competition? What new authorities or capabilities are needed?

5. **Resilience vs. Leverage:** Should strategy emphasize building resilience (reducing dependencies) or developing counter-leverage (new chokepoints)?

6. **Cooperation vs. Competition:** In domains requiring cooperation (climate, pandemics, space debris), how do you cooperate with strategic competitors?

7. **Scenario Planning:** What other future scenarios should policymakers prepare for:
   - Quantum computing breaking encryption
   - Artificial general intelligence (AGI) breakthroughs
   - Climate tipping points forcing cooperation
   - Global economic decoupling into blocs
   - Proliferation of autonomous weapons

8. **Adaptation Strategy:** How should U.S. policy evolve to address 2030s challenges:
   - Institutional reforms (new agencies, authorities)?
   - Allied coordination mechanisms?
   - Public-private partnerships?
   - Technology investment and development?
   - Education and workforce development?
