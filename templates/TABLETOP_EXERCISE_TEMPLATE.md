# Tabletop Exercise Template

## Purpose

Tabletop exercises provide interactive, scenario-based learning that allows participants to apply concepts from the chapter in a realistic strategic competition context. Each chapter should include one 60-90 minute exercise.

**Learning Philosophy:**
- **Active learning**: Better retention through doing than passive reading
- **Multi-perspectival**: Forces participants to think from different actors' viewpoints
- **Uncertainty**: Simulates fog of war and imperfect information
- **Trade-offs**: Highlights difficult choices between competing objectives
- **Consequences**: Shows how actions cascade and create second-order effects

**General Guidelines**:
- Each move is a decision point where factions choose actions
- Facilitator presents situation, factions huddle (5-10 minutes), present decisions, facilitator narrates consequences
- Factions can negotiate/communicate between moves if desired
- Keep time pressure on - realism comes from partial information and rushed decisions

---

#### Move 1: Initial Response

**Time**: 15 minutes (5 min huddle + 5 min presentations + 5 min facilitator transition)

**Situation Update**:
[What new information or event triggers the need for decisions]

**Example:** "Breaking: China has announced export controls on [critical material/technology]. Markets are reacting with [stock price movements]. You have [timeframe] to respond before [deadline/consequence]."

**Decision Prompts** (by faction):

**For US**:
- Do you respond with immediate countermeasures or attempt de-escalation?
- What specific tools do you activate?
- How do you coordinate with allies?
- What is your public messaging?

**For China**:
- How do you explain and justify your action to domestic and international audiences?
- Do you offer any off-ramps or is this non-negotiable?
- How do you pressure allies to resist US coordination?
- What economic cushions do you activate to absorb retaliation?

**For Allies**:
- Do you join US response immediately, negotiate terms, or decline to participate?
- What are your specific asks/concerns?
- Do you pursue separate diplomatic track?

**For [Faction 4]**:
- [Relevant decision prompts]

**Options Menu** (for each faction):
[Provide 3-5 specific option templates participants can choose or modify]
- **Option A**: [Conservative/status quo approach] - [Brief description] - [Likely consequences]
- **Option B**: [Moderate/balanced approach] - [Description] - [Consequences]

---

#### Move 2: Escalation and Complications

**Time**: 20 minutes

**Situation Update**:
[Facilitator narrates how the situation has evolved based on Move 1 choices]
[Introduce new complication or information that changes calculus]

**Example:** "Your Move 1 actions have had the following effects: [Describe outcomes]. However, new intelligence suggests [complicating factor]. Meanwhile, [third party] has announced [relevant action]. You have [timeframe] to decide your next move."

**New Information**:
- [Intelligence update]
- [Market reaction]
- [Allied response or pressure]
- [Domestic political development]
- [Unexpected third-party action]

**Decision Prompts** (by faction):

**For US**:
- Do you escalate further or attempt de-escalation?
- How do you manage allied concerns/defections?
- What costs are you willing to accept?
- Is your signaling being understood as intended?

---

#### Move 3: Resolution or Critical Decision

**Time**: 20 minutes

**Situation Update**:
[Describe how previous moves have created a critical juncture]
[Frame the stakes clearly - what happens if no resolution or if wrong choice made]

**Example:** "The situation has reached a critical point. Financial markets are [condition]. Allied unity is [status]. Chinese domestic politics are [pressure]. Both sides have [specific assets at risk]. This is a decision point that will determine whether the crisis escalates into [worse outcome] or begins to de-escalate toward [better outcome]."

**Critical Decision** (varies by scenario):
- Does one side blink first?
- Is there a negotiated settlement?
- Do allies successfully mediate?
- Does the crisis escalate into broader conflict?
- Is there an asymmetric surprise move?

**Decision Prompts**: [Final choice for each faction]

**Endgame Options**:
1. **De-escalation/Settlement**: [What would this look like? Who wins/loses?]
2. **Continued Standoff**: [Describe new status quo]
3. **Escalation**: [How does it escalate further? New domains?]
4. **Asymmetric Move**: [Unexpected action that changes game]

**Consequences**:
[Facilitator describes outcomes based on final choices]
- Economic: [Market reactions, growth impacts]

---

### Facilitator Guide

**Pre-Exercise Preparation** (1-2 hours):

1. **Read chapter thoroughly** and identify key concepts to reinforce
2. **Prepare materials**: Print role cards, scenario handouts, maps/data
3. **Room setup**: Arrange tables for faction huddles, central area for presentations
4. **Prepare tracking board**: Flip chart or whiteboard to track actions and timeline
5. **Decision matrix**: Pre-build consequence tree for different faction choices
6. **Study historical cases**: Be ready to cite real examples in debrief

**During Exercise - Facilitator Roles**:

1. **Timekeeper**: Keep moves on schedule; use time pressure to create realism
2. **Narrator**: Describe consequences vividly; inject new information at right moments
3. **Referee**: Adjudicate what tools can/can't do based on chapter content
4. **Observer**: Note interesting dynamics, creative solutions, misconceptions for debrief
5. **Realism enforcer**: Push back on implausible choices; ask "how would you actually do this?"

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:

- **Participants forget constraints**: Remind of legal limits, political costs, allied concerns
- **Discussions become academic**: Keep focused on "What would you actually do?" not "What should ideal policy be?"
- **Factions don't coordinate internally**: Encourage huddles to produce unified position
- **Escalation spirals out of control**: Can pause and ask "Are you sure?" before committing to extreme actions
- **Time management**: Don't let Move 1 consume too much time at expense of Moves 2-3

**Adapting for Different Group Sizes**:

- **Small groups (8-12)**: Combine factions (e.g., lump all allies together), focus on US vs. China
- **Medium groups (12-20)**: Standard 4-faction format
- **Large groups (20+)**: Split factions into sub-groups (e.g., separate EU, Japan, South Korea) or run multiple parallel exercises

**Difficulty Levels**:

- **Easier**: Provide more structure, clearer options, more information, less ambiguity
- **Harder**: Remove options menu, inject more uncertainty, add time pressure, introduce surprise injects mid-move

**Variations**:

1. **Multi-session format**: Run over several meetings with research time between moves
2. **Red team**: Have experts play adversary role to increase realism
3. **Historical replay**: Use actual crisis scenario, see if participants reach different outcome
4. **Solo/small group**: Can be adapted as structured decision-making exercise even without full group

**Post-Exercise Follow-up**:

- Encourage participants to read deeper on topics that surprised them
- Suggest related chapters or readings
- Can assign reflection paper on what they learned

---

### Assessment and Learning Outcomes

**Informal Assessment** (during debrief):
- Did participants demonstrate understanding of tools from chapter?
- Could they articulate trade-offs and constraints?
- Did they think strategically about adversary responses?
- Were they able to apply concepts to new situation?

**Optional Formal Assessment**:
- Reflection paper: "What did you learn from the exercise that you didn't get from reading alone?"
- Policy memo: "Based on the exercise, write a 2-page memo recommending US strategy for [scenario topic]"
- Comparative analysis: "How did the exercise scenario compare to the [historical case] from the chapter?"

## Example: Tabletop Exercise on Rare Earth Export Controls

### Title: Critical Minerals Coercion - The Rare Earth Crisis of 2026

**Chapter**: Chapter 3 - Critical Sectors: Food, Energy, and Minerals

**Topic**: Chinese export controls on rare earth processing and US/allied response

**Time Required**: 90 minutes

**Participants**: 12-20 (adaptable)

**Materials Needed**:
- Handout: "Global Rare Earth Supply Chain" (map + data)
- Handout: "US Defense Programs Dependent on Rare Earths" (table)
- Faction role cards
- Flip chart to track timeline

---

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, participants should be able to:

1. **Identify** the strategic importance of rare earth elements for defense and civilian technology
2. **Analyze** the asymmetry between Chinese dominance in rare earth processing and US/allied vulnerabilities
3. **Design** a multi-faceted response combining short-term mitigation and long-term supply chain diversification
4. **Evaluate** trade-offs between immediate retaliation and strategic patience
5. **Articulate** Chinese perspective on rare earth controls as defensive response to US technology restrictions

---

### Scenario Setup

**Date**: March 15, 2026

**Situation**:

Following escalating US export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China over the past 18 months, Beijing has retaliated by imposing comprehensive export restrictions on processed rare earth elements, particularly the magnetic materials (neodymium, dysprosium, terbium) essential for advanced weapons systems, electric vehicles, and renewable energy technology.

On March 12, 2026, China's Ministry of Commerce announced "temporary export controls" on processed rare earth oxides and magnetic materials citing "national security concerns and supply chain integrity." While technically framed as similar to US export controls, the measures effectively cut off 85% of global rare earth magnetic material supply overnight.

US Defense Department officials immediately warned that multiple major weapons programs face imminent disruptions: F-35 fighters, Virginia-class submarines, THAAD missile interceptors, and precision-guided munitions all depend on rare earth permanent magnets that China is now restricting. Electric vehicle manufacturers and wind turbine producers also face shortages within 3-6 months as stockpiles run down.

Beijing has offered to continue exports to countries that "respect mutual benefit and don't politicize trade relationships" - code for rejecting US requests for export control coordination. This puts European and Asian allies in a difficult position: side with Washington and face immediate economic pain, or break ranks to maintain access.

**Recent Timeline**:
- **September 2024**: US expands semiconductor export controls to cover additional chip-making equipment
- **November 2024**: Netherlands and Japan partially comply with US requests to restrict ASML and Tokyo Electron exports
- **March 2025**: China restricts exports of gallium and germanium (semiconductor inputs)
- **December 2025**: US adds Chinese memory chip makers to Entity List, threatening their survival
- **February 2026**: Xi Jinping gives speech warning of "necessary countermeasures to defend China's development rights"
- **March 12, 2026**: China announces rare earth export controls (scenario start)
- **March 15, 2026 (TODAY)**: NSC Principals Committee meeting to formulate response

**Economic Context**:
- China controls 85% of global rare earth processing (despite only 35% of reserves)
- US rare earth mining ramping up but processing capacity won't be online until 2028-2029
- US defense industrial base has 3-6 month stockpiles of critical materials
- Global rare earth prices surge 200-300% overnight on news
- Chinese exports of rare earth products: ~$3 billion annually
- Value of US/allied products dependent on rare earths: ~$500 billion annually (massive asymmetry in economic leverage)

**Key Uncertainty**:
Is this temporary coercive measure to force US to moderate semiconductor controls, or first step in permanent decoupling of critical mineral supply chains? Will China actually enforce the controls strictly or use them selectively for political leverage?

**Map**: [Include map showing: rare earth reserves by country, processing capacity, US/allied dependencies, supply chain]

---

### Factions

#### Faction 1: United States Government

**Represented by**: NSC Principals Committee
- National Security Advisor (leads faction)
- Secretary of Defense
- Secretary of Commerce
- Secretary of Energy
- Secretary of State

**Core Objectives**:
1. **Ensure defense readiness**: Prevent disruption to critical weapons programs
2. **Allied coordination**: Keep allies aligned despite economic pain
3. **Long-term supply security**: Accelerate domestic/friendly processing capacity
4. **Avoid capitulation**: Don't let China force rollback of semiconductor controls

**Key Considerations**:
- Defense emergency: Programs at risk in 3-6 months
- Allied unity: EU, Japan, South Korea under pressure to defect
- Economic costs: EV and renewable sectors face disruption
- Public opinion: Defense readiness concerns vs. economic pain
- Congressional pressure: Expect hearings and demands for action
- Long-term strategy: Can't let China permanently weaponize chokepoint

**Available Tools**:
- **Trade**: WTO complaint (though unlikely to resolve quickly), retaliatory tariffs
- **Finance**: Consider sanctions on Chinese rare earth companies (though counterproductive?)
- **Procurement**: DPA Title III to fund emergency production, stockpile purchases
- **Diplomatic**: Coordinate with allies on alternative suppliers (Australia, Canada, Africa), pressure China
- **R&D**: Accelerate substitution research, alternative materials
- **Strategic**: Release from National Defense Stockpile (temporary fix)
- **Regulatory**: Streamline permitting for US rare earth processing facilities

**Information**:
- **High confidence**: China has near-monopoly on processing; US vulnerable for 3-6 months
- **Medium confidence**: Australia/Canada capacity could come online in 18-24 months with crash program
- **Low confidence**: Will China enforce controls strictly or selectively? Is this negotiating tactic or permanent policy?

**Success Metrics**:
- No major weapons programs disrupted
- Allies remain coordinated
- Clear path to supply chain diversification within 24 months
- China sees costs of weaponization

---

#### Faction 2: China

**Represented by**: Politburo Standing Committee Economic Working Group
- PBSC Member responsible for economy
- MOFCOM Minister
- NDRC Chairman
- MFA (Foreign Affairs Office)

**Core Objectives**:
1. **Force US to moderate semiconductor controls**: Create leverage for negotiations
2. **Demonstrate costs of decoupling**: Show US that "small yard, high fence" has consequences
3. **Split US alliance**: Peel off European and Asian partners who need rare earths
4. **Protect Chinese development**: Ensure "comprehensive national security" by controlling strategic resources

**Key Considerations**:
- CCP legitimacy: Cannot appear weak in face of US pressure
- Economic costs: Rare earth sector employs relatively few people; export revenue modest
- International image: Need to avoid looking like aggressor; frame as defensive
- Domestic development: China also needs rare earths; must ensure domestic supply first
- Long-term strategy: Weaponizing rare earths may accelerate global diversification (double-edged sword)

**Available Tools**:
- **Export controls**: Can make stricter or more selective; could target specific countries
- **Licensing**: Can approve exports to "friendly" countries to split alliance
- **Production control**: Can manipulate prices by flooding/restricting production
- **Diplomatic**: Offer deals to EU, Japan, South Korea (market access in exchange for export control non-participation)
- **Strategic**: Stockpile additional rare earths domestically before tightening controls
- **Narrative**: Public messaging about US "bullying" and China's right to defend development

**Information**:
- **High confidence**: US highly dependent; defense sector immediately impacted
- **Medium confidence**: Allied unity fragile; economic pressure will create defections
- **Low confidence**: How long can US endure? Will they cave on semiconductors or find alternatives?

**Success Metrics**:
- US enters negotiations on semiconductor controls
- At least one major ally (EU, Japan, or South Korea) defects from export control coordination
- Rare earth controls demonstrate credible retaliation capability
- Domestic political win (Xi shows strength)

---

#### Faction 3: Allied Countries (EU, Japan, South Korea)

**Represented by**: Combined allied coordination (can split into sub-factions if large group)
- EU: High Representative, Commissioner for Trade
- Japan: METI, MOFA
- South Korea: MOTIE, Blue House NSC

**Core Objectives**:
1. **Maintain rare earth access**: Economic survival requires processing materials
2. **Alliance solidarity**: Don't want to rupture US relationship
3. **Strategic autonomy**: Develop own supply chains to avoid being whipsawed
4. **Avoid choosing sides**: Find middle path that preserves ties with both

**Key Considerations**:
- Economic exposure: EU green transition, Japanese electronics, Korean EVs all depend on rare earths
- Security dependence: Still rely on US for extended deterrence
- Domestic politics: Industry lobbies demanding rare earth access; security hawks demanding US solidarity
- Historical experience: Have been here before (2010 Japan-China rare earth dispute)
- Long-term strategy: Need supply chain resilience regardless of current crisis outcome

**Available Tools**:
- **Diplomatic**: Mediate between US and China; offer compromise proposals
- **Economic**: Can implement own rare earth strategies (Australia/Canada partnerships)
- **Regulatory**: Fast-track processing capacity development
- **Conditional cooperation**: Tell US will coordinate on semiconductors only if US helps with rare earth alternatives
- **Messaging**: Public and private communications to both sides

**Information**:
- **High confidence**: Both US and China need allied cooperation
- **Medium confidence**: Australia/Canada could partially substitute but will take time and investment
- **Low confidence**: How far will US-China confrontation escalate? Is there off-ramp?

**Success Metrics**:
- Rare earth access continues (either from China or rapid alternatives)
- US doesn't punish for pragmatic China engagement
- Increased strategic autonomy in critical minerals
- Crisis doesn't escalate to broader conflict

---

### Move 1: Immediate Response (15 minutes)

**Situation**: It is March 15, 2026, 72 hours after Chinese announcement. Markets are panicking, defense contractors are calling the Pentagon, and allied capitals are demanding US leadership. You have until end of week to announce initial response.

**For US**:
Do you:
- **A. Retaliate immediately** (tariffs on Chinese exports, consider rare earth sanctions)
- **B. Strategic patience** (absorb cost, accelerate alternatives, don't escalate)
- **C. Negotiate** (signal willingness to discuss semiconductor controls in exchange for rare earth access)
- **D. Allied emergency program** (crash program with Australia/Canada/EU for alternative supply)

**For China**:
Do you:
- **A. Strict enforcement** (no exceptions; demonstrate resolve)
- **B. Selective enforcement** (license exports to EU/Japan who distance from US controls)
- **C. Negotiating signal** (hint at flexibility if US moderates semiconductors)
- **D. Escalate further** (announce additional material restrictions)

**For Allies**:
Do you:
- **A. Full US solidarity** (join any US retaliation despite economic cost)
- **B. Conditional support** (support US if they help with alternatives)
- **C. Separate negotiations** (quietly approach China for exemptions)
- **D. Mediation** (propose trilateral talks)

[Factions huddle, present decisions, facilitator narrates consequences]

---

### Move 2: Complications and Escalation (20 minutes)

**Situation Update**: [Based on Move 1 choices]

**New Information**:
- Defense contractors confirm F-35 production will halt in 90 days without rare earth magnets
- China has quietly offered Germany continued rare earth access if it halts semiconductor equipment exports (leaked to press)
- Australia announces willingness to massively expand processing but needs $5 billion investment and 18 months
- Rare earth prices now up 400%; EV manufacturers warning of production cuts
- Congressional hawks introduce bill mandating full embargo on Chinese imports if rare earth controls not lifted

**Complications**:
- If US retaliated: China has responded by [escalation], markets further spooked
- If US negotiated: Congressional Republicans accusing Biden of "appeasing China"
- If allies tried separate approach: US officials leak criticism of "free riding"

**Decision Prompts**: How do you adjust strategy given new information?

[Continue with decision options and faction choices]

---

### Move 3: Critical Decision (20 minutes)

**Situation**: The crisis has reached a point where a choice must be made between:
1. Long-term strategic confrontation with significant near-term pain
2. Negotiated settlement that preserves some access but may appear as retreat
3. Allied-led alternative that reduces dependence on both US and China

**Final Choices and Consequences**: [Facilitator describes endgame based on final faction decisions]

---

### Debrief

[Use standard debrief questions from template]

**Key Learning Points** (for facilitator to emphasize):
- Asymmetry in economic coercion: China has more leverage on rare earths than US has on semiconductors short-term
- Time horizons matter: US can win long game (alternatives) but may lose short game (defense readiness)
- Allied coordination is hard when costs are unequal
- First-mover advantage in securing supply chains
- Weaponization of dependencies accelerates diversification
- Domestic politics constrain options on both sides
- Trade-off between immediate pain and long-term resilience
