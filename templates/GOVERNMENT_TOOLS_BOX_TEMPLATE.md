## Examples of Completed Government Tools Boxes

### Example 1: IEEPA

**Legal Authority**

**Statute**: International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. §§ 1701-1707

**Key Provisions**: IEEPA grants the President broad authority to regulate economic transactions following a declaration of national emergency. Once a national emergency is declared under the National Emergencies Act, the President may prohibit or regulate imports, exports, foreign exchange transactions, transfers of credit, and dealings in property in which a foreign country or national has an interest.

**Limitations**:
- Requires declaration of national emergency under National Emergencies Act (NEA)
- Congress may terminate national emergency by joint resolution
- President must report to Congress within 30 days and every 6 months thereafter
- Does not authorize regulation of personal communications or donations of food/medicine
- Subject to judicial review for constitutionality and statutory compliance

**Implementing Agency**

**Primary Agency**: Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)

**Supporting Agencies**: Department of State (policy guidance), Department of Commerce (export controls coordination), Department of Justice (enforcement and prosecutions)

**Regulatory Framework**: 31 C.F.R. Part 500 series (various country-specific and list-based sanctions programs)

**How It Works**

**Trigger/Threshold**: President must determine there exists "any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States."

**Process**:
1. President declares national emergency under NEA with regard to specific threat
2. President issues Executive Order under IEEPA authority specifying prohibited transactions
3. OFAC issues regulations implementing the Executive Order
4. OFAC publishes and maintains lists (e.g., SDN List) of designated persons and entities
5. US persons must comply; violations subject to civil and criminal penalties
6. Annual emergency renewals required under NEA

**Scope**:
- **Can do**: Block assets, prohibit transactions, ban imports/exports, restrict financial services, impose secondary sanctions on non-US persons
- **Cannot do**: Directly regulate transactions solely between foreign parties outside US jurisdiction (but secondary sanctions can create indirect pressure)

**Duration**: National emergencies continue until explicitly terminated; require annual renewal by Presidential notice

**Recent Applications (2020-2025)**

**Example 1: Russia Sanctions (February 2022-present)**
- **Date**: February 2022 (major expansion), with ongoing additions
- **Target**: Russian government, financial institutions, oligarchs, defense sector
- **Rationale**: Response to invasion of Ukraine
- **Specific Measures**: Blocked Central Bank of Russia assets, SDN designations of major banks (Sberbank, VTB), export restrictions on technology, secondary sanctions on those dealing with designated entities
- **Outcome**: Severe immediate economic disruption; ruble crash, capital flight. Long-term effectiveness debated as Russia adapts through parallel import schemes and yuan-based trade.

**Example 2: China Technology Restrictions (August 2020)**
- **Date**: August 2020, expanded in 2021-2023
- **Target**: Chinese technology companies including Huawei, ZTE, ByteDance (TikTok), Tencent
- **Rationale**: National security concerns regarding data collection and critical infrastructure
- **Specific Measures**: Executive Order prohibiting transactions with ByteDance and Tencent; sanctions on Huawei limiting access to US semiconductors and software; restrictions on Chinese companies accessing US capital markets
- **Outcome**: Mixed - TikTok sale negotiations dragged on for years; Huawei severely impacted, lost access to Google services and advanced chips; increased China's resolve to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency

**Example 3: Iran Maximum Pressure (2018-2021)**
- **Date**: May 2018 (reimposition after JCPOA withdrawal), continued through 2020
- **Target**: Iranian government, oil sector, financial institutions, IRGC
- **Rationale**: Counter Iran's nuclear program, regional activities, and ballistic missile development
- **Specific Measures**: Re-imposed all pre-JCPOA sanctions; ended oil waivers (trying to reduce Iranian exports to zero); sanctioned Iran's central bank; designated IRGC as Foreign Terrorist Organization
- **Outcome**: Severe economic pressure (oil exports dropped ~90%, GDP contracted), but Iran expanded nuclear program and did not change regional behavior; contributed to US-Iran crisis (Soleimani strike, January 2020)

**Strengths and Limitations**

**Strengths**:
- **Speed and Flexibility**: President can impose sanctions quickly in response to emerging threats without Congressional approval
- **Comprehensive Scope**: Covers virtually all economic transactions, giving whole-of-economy leverage
- **US Financial System Centrality**: Dollar dominance and US role in global finance make IEEPA sanctions difficult to evade
- **Precedent**: Decades of practice have created robust implementation procedures and compliance infrastructure

**Limitations**:
- **Legal**: Broad Presidential discretion has been challenged (though courts generally defer); emergency declarations must be plausibly connected to genuine threats
- **Political**: Requires annual renewal of national emergencies, creating Congressional oversight opportunity; can become politicized (e.g., border wall emergency)
- **Economic**: Costs to US companies and allies; incentivizes de-dollarization and alternative payment systems; can harm humanitarian situations
- **International**: Effectiveness depends on allied cooperation; unilateral sanctions easier to evade; secondary sanctions strain alliances
- **Adaptation**: Targets develop workarounds (shell companies, cryptocurrency, non-dollar trade, import substitution)

**Effectiveness Considerations**

**When This Tool Works Well**:
- Target is integrated into US-dominated financial system
- Multilateral support from allies (EU, Japan, etc.)
- Goal is to impose costs or signal resolve rather than achieve specific behavioral change
- Target government faces domestic economic pressure

**When This Tool Works Poorly**:
- Target already isolated from US financial system (e.g., North Korea)
- Unilateral sanctions without allied buy-in
- Demands require target to compromise core security interests
- Long-term sanctions without clear exit ramps lead to adaptation

**Empirical Evidence**:
Research shows sanctions achieve foreign policy objectives in only 20-40% of cases (Hufbauer et al.). Financial sanctions under IEEPA are more effective than trade sanctions, but effectiveness has declined over time as targets learn to adapt. Targeted "smart sanctions" (SDN list) more effective than comprehensive embargoes at minimizing humanitarian costs.
