## Example: Chinese Perspective on Semiconductor Export Controls

### Historical Context and Formative Experiences

**The "Century of Humiliation" Resonance**:
Chinese strategists explicitly compare current US semiconductor export controls to the economic restrictions imposed by Western powers and Japan during the late Qing and Republican periods. The narrative emphasizes that foreign powers have historically used technological superiority to subjugate China, and that the Communist Party's legitimacy rests in part on ensuring this never happens again.

**Cold War Embargo**:
From 1949 to 1979, China was subject to Western (CoCom) technology embargo. Chinese engineers achieved independent breakthroughs (two bombs, one satellite) despite this isolation, creating a national mythology around self-reliance (自力更生, zìlì gēngshēng). However, China also fell far behind during this period, which leaders see as a cautionary tale about the costs of isolation.

**Post-1979 Integration**:
China's rapid development after 1979 relied heavily on technology transfer through trade, FDI, and joint ventures. This created both gratitude for the benefits of integration and anxiety about dependency, especially after the 1999 Cox Committee report and post-Tiananmen sanctions showed that access could be revoked.

**Key Historical Lessons Chinese Leaders Draw**:
1. **Technological dependency is strategic vulnerability**: Foreign-controlled chokepoints (operating systems, chip design tools, advanced manufacturing) can be weaponized
2. **"Kicking away the ladder"**: Once advanced, Western powers try to prevent catch-up by changing rules
3. **Self-reliance is achievable but costly**: Historical breakthroughs possible but require massive state mobilization and accepting slower growth

---

### Strategic Logic and Threat Perception

**Core Interests at Stake**:
- **Economic development**: Semiconductors are foundation of modern economy; restrictions threaten growth model
- **Military modernization**: Advanced chips essential for AI, quantum, hypersonics, and military platforms
- **Regime legitimacy**: CCP's social contract based on delivering rising living standards and national strength; tech containment threatens both
- **Great power status**: Xi's "China Dream" of national rejuvenation requires technology leadership; permanent subordination unacceptable

**Perceived Threats**:
1. **Strategic Containment**: Export controls seen not as isolated national security measure but as cornerstone of broader US strategy to prevent China from becoming peer competitor. Chinese analysts point to NSS 2017/2022, "whole of government" approach, and coordination with allies as evidence.
2. **Innovation Suppression**: Restrictions on EDA tools, manufacturing equipment, and architectures seen as attempt to freeze China in permanent technological inferiority.
3. **Alliance Encirclement**: US pressure on Netherlands (ASML), Japan (Tokyo Electron), South Korea (Samsung, SK Hynix), and Taiwan (TSMC) interpreted as building "chip NATO" against China.
4. **Decoupling Prelude**: Current export controls viewed as first phase of broader economic decoupling that will cascade across industries.

**Strategic Objectives**:
- **Near-term**: Minimize damage from current controls through stockpiling, smuggling, and diplomatic pressure
- **Medium-term**: Achieve breakthrough in key chokepoints (EUV lithography, EDA software, advanced packaging)
- **Long-term**: Build indigenous semiconductor ecosystem and potentially establish own dependent sphere (BRI countries, Global South)

---

### Official Position and Policy Responses

**Official Statements**:

1. **Ministry of Foreign Affairs Regular Briefing** (October 7, 2022 - response to October 7 export controls)
   - **Key Quote**: "The US politicizes and weaponizes technology and trade issues...These actions undermine international trade rules, disrupt the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains, and harm the interests of all countries."
   - **Significance**: Frames issue as violation of global norms, not just bilateral dispute

2. **State Council White Paper "China and the World in the New Era"** (September 2019)
   - **Key Quote**: "Some countries...have imposed economic and technological blockades...China firmly opposes technological hegemonism and seeks to make science and technology benefit all humanity"
   - **Significance**: Positioned China as defender of openness against Western protectionism (ironic given Chinese own restrictions)

**Legislative Responses**:
- **Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law** (June 2021): Provides legal framework for Chinese countermeasures, including blocking enforcement of foreign sanctions, seizing assets, and prohibiting compliance with extraterritorial US rules
- **Export Control Law** (December 2020): Creates symmetrical export control system for "dual-use items and other goods," enabling China to impose own technology restrictions
- **Data Security Law** (September 2021): Restricts data flows to protect "national security," creating leverage point for retaliation

**Practical Countermeasures**:
1. **Stockpiling**: Massive purchases of chips and manufacturing equipment before controls take full effect (2022-2023)
2. **Unreliable Entity List**: Threatened (though rarely used) designation of US companies that comply with controls, potentially cutting them off from Chinese market
3. **Litigation**: Chinese companies (e.g., SMIC) challenge controls in international forums and US courts
4. **Diplomatic pressure**: Bilateral negotiations with Netherlands, Japan, South Korea to resist US pressure; BRI incentives for non-cooperation

**Institutional Developments**:
- **Central Committee Science and Technology Commission** (March 2023): Elevated science/tech to central-level priority with direct Party oversight
- **Big Fund** (国家集成电路产业投资基金): Phase I ($22B, 2014), Phase II ($29B, 2019), Phase III (~$41B, 2024) pouring state capital into semiconductor sector
- **Leading Small Groups**: Coordination across ministries (MIIT, MOFCOM, MOST, MFA) to implement "whole-of-government" response

---

### Key Chinese Strategic Concepts

**科技自立自强** (kējì zìlì zìqiáng) - "Self-Reliance and Self-Strengthening in Science and Technology"
- **Definition**: Achieving independent innovation capacity and reducing critical technological dependencies on potentially hostile foreign powers
- **Origin**: Xi Jinping articulated this as key principle at 2020 Fifth Plenum; combines Maoist "self-reliance" with late Qing "self-strengthening" movement
- **Application**: Export controls validate Chinese fears of dependency; self-reliance now central to 14th Five-Year Plan and Made in China 2025; massive subsidies for domestic semiconductor industry framed as national security imperative

**双循环** (shuāng xúnhuán) - "Dual Circulation"
- **Definition**: Economic strategy emphasizing domestic circulation (内循环) as primary with international circulation (外循环) as supplement; reduce export/FDI dependence, expand domestic consumption and innovation
- **Origin**: Articulated by Xi in May 2020 in response to COVID, US tech restrictions, and trade war
- **Application**: Semiconductor self-reliance is key pillar of domestic circulation strategy; can't rely on TSMC/Samsung when US can cut access; must build indigenous supply chains

**卡脖子** (qiǎ bózi) - "Chokepoint" or literally "strangling the neck"
- **Definition**: Critical technologies where foreign control creates vulnerability; China identifies ~35 "chokepoint technologies" that must be indigenized
- **Origin**: Term used in Chinese industrial policy since 1990s, elevated by Xi Jinping to describe strategic vulnerabilities
- **Application**: Semiconductors are THE chokepoint; EUV lithography, EDA software, advanced packaging identified as specific bottlenecks within the bottleneck; massive R&D focus on breaking through these barriers

---

### Legitimacy Narratives and International Messaging

**Development Rights**:
China argues it has right to develop advanced technology to raise living standards of 1.4 billion people; current Western restrictions are attempt to keep China poor and subordinate. "No one can deprive the Chinese people of their right to pursue a better life," Xi stated in October 2022 speech.

**Historical Justice**:
After suffering technological backwardness imposed by Western imperialism for a century, China has legitimate grievance if the West tries to reassert technological dominance through discriminatory controls. This resonates with Global South countries who see parallels to their own development constraints.

**Reciprocity**:
China portrays itself as victim responding to US aggression, not instigator. Chinese controls on gallium, germanium, graphite export (July 2023, December 2023) framed as defensive measures, though they preceded actual US actions. "Who is politicizing trade?" is common rhetorical question.

**Rules-Based Order**:
China invokes WTO principles against discriminatory treatment, despite its own violations. Appeals to developing countries by framing US controls as violation of free trade principles that harm all emerging economies.

**Peace vs. Hegemony**:
China contrasts its "peaceful rise" with US "hegemony" and "bloc politics." Claims semiconductor controls are part of "new Cold War" mentality, while China offers inclusive development (BRI, South-South cooperation).

### Debates and Alternatives Within China

**Elite Debates** (subtle and constrained):

**"Techno-nationalists" vs. "Globalists"**:
- **Techno-nationalist view**: Complete decoupling inevitable and perhaps desirable; China should prioritize self-reliance even at high economic cost; indigenous substitution is achievable within a decade with sufficient resources
  - Associated with: Some MIIT officials, military-industrial complex, older cadres
- **Globalist view**: Complete self-reliance impossible or prohibitively expensive; should maintain integration where possible, retaliate selectively, and use market access as leverage for negotiations
  - Associated with: Some MOFCOM officials, coastal provinces dependent on trade, younger technocrats

**Current Trajectory**: Xi appears closer to techno-nationalist camp, but policy includes elements of both (massive self-reliance investment AND efforts to preserve access through diplomacy).

**Academic Discussions**:
Chinese IR scholars debate whether US policy represents:
- Temporary bipartisan aberration that could reverse with leadership change
- Permanent structural shift requiring fundamental Chinese strategic adjustment
- Bluff that will collapse when US companies lobby for market access

Some scholars advocate de-escalation and reassurance; others call for symmetric countermeasures; debate is real but constrained by political redlines.

**Constraints on Leadership**:
- **Economic costs**: Semiconductor self-reliance extremely expensive; subsidies create debt, inefficiency, corruption
- **Timeline**: Even massive investment may take 10-15 years to achieve breakthrough in EUV and advanced nodes
- **Talent**: Shortage of world-class engineers and scientists despite efforts to recruit/train
- **Domestic backlash**: If restrictions slow economic growth, public discontent could threaten stability
- **Allied unity**: If China overreacts with too-aggressive countermeasures, pushes fence-sitters (EU, Japan, South Korea) toward US

---

### Implications for US/Western Strategy

**What is Unlikely to Work**:
- **Expecting capitulation**: China sees this as existential; will pay high costs to avoid permanent technological subordination
- **Assuming cooperation**: China will not cooperate in monitoring/enforcing controls; will actively work to evade
- **Underestimating resilience**: Historical precedent (1950s-70s) shows China can achieve breakthroughs through massive state mobilization when isolated

**What Might Be More Effective**:
- **Narrow tailoring**: Controls that target military applications while preserving commercial integration more sustainable and less likely to unify Chinese society in opposition
- **Allied coordination**: Without Dutch/Japanese cooperation, controls easier to evade
- **Positive inducements**: Offering path to restored access if China accepts verifiable military restrictions (e.g., arms control model)
- **Exploit opportunity costs**: Highlighting how self-reliance push drains resources from other priorities (healthcare, social welfare, environmental protection) could strengthen Chinese globalists

**Signaling**:
- **Credibility**: Controls must be enforced to deter evasion; selective prosecution undermines deterrence
- **Red lines**: US should clearly communicate what changes in Chinese behavior would lead to relaxation
- **Escalation management**: Automatic escalation spirals dangerous; need circuit breakers

**Long-term**:
- Chinese technological capacity will likely improve regardless of controls, but timeline matters
- If controls buy 5-10 years before China achieves breakthroughs, window for diplomatic resolution or shifting to other issues
- Generational change: Younger Chinese technocrats may be more pragmatic if nationalist fervor fades
