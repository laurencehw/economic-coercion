## Key Success Factors

### Maintain Quality Standards
- **Word count:** Each chapter 10,000-12,000 words (Chapter 9 may be longer)
- **Chinese Perspective Boxes:** Mandatory in every chapter, 2,000-2,500 words with characters/pinyin
- **Case studies:** 2-3 per chapter applying four-dimension framework
- **Government Tools Boxes:** 2 per chapter with legal citations
- **Data sources:** Comprehensive guides in each chapter
- **Visualizations:** 6-8 placeholders per chapter for later production

### Consistent Analytical Framework
Apply throughout all chapters:
- **Four dimensions:** Domain, Target, Objective, Intensity
- **Five effectiveness criteria:** Compliance, degradation, cost, sustainability, collateral damage
- **Strategic empathy:** Chinese perspectives with genuine historical context
- **Multi-audience:** Executive summaries for policymakers, detailed analysis for students, data for practitioners

### Git Workflow
- Commit after completing each major section (not just at end of chapter)
- Descriptive commit messages with section summaries
- Push to `develop` branch regularly
- Merge to `main` only when chapter fully complete
- Tag major milestones (Chapter 5 complete, etc.)

### Time Management
- **Realistic pacing:** 2 weeks per chapter for Chapters 4-8
- **Longer for complex chapters:** 3 weeks for Chapter 9 (multiple historical cases)
- **Buffer time:** Built into 28-week timeline for unexpected delays
- **Parallel work:** Can start visualizations while finishing final chapters

## Potential Challenges and Mitigation

### Challenge 1: Maintaining Momentum
- **Risk:** Burnout or loss of focus across 10 chapters
- **Mitigation:**
  * Celebrate milestones (each chapter completion)
  * Vary writing (alternate between analytical sections and case studies)
  * Take breaks between chapters to refresh
  * Remember the end goal: publication-quality textbook

### Challenge 2: Data and Source Access
- **Risk:** Some proprietary data (TechInsights, industry reports) expensive or inaccessible
- **Mitigation:**
  * Use open sources where possible (USGS, IEA, government reports)
  * University library access for academic databases
  * Company annual reports (free for public companies)
  * Think tank reports (most freely available)
  * Note gaps and limitations where data unavailable

### Challenge 3: Rapidly Changing Events
- **Risk:** New developments (sanctions, export controls, crises) date the analysis
- **Mitigation:**
  * Focus on structural dynamics and patterns, not just current events
  * Note timeframes clearly ("as of 2024...")
  * Build in "future developments" sections
  * Plan for second edition incorporating major changes
  * Accept that contemporary analysis involves some obsolescence risk

### Challenge 4: Visualization Production
- **Risk:** Creating 70-80 high-quality figures is time-consuming and technically demanding
- **Mitigation:**
  * Prioritize most impactful visualizations (Phases 1-2 in VISUALIZATION_PLAN)
  * Use Python/R for reproducibility and quality
  * Template consistent styling early
  * Consider professional graphic designer for final polish
  * Some figures can be simpler (tables, basic charts) vs complex (maps, Sankey diagrams)

### Challenge 5: Chinese Language and Perspectives
- **Risk:** Ensuring authentic Chinese perspective representation without over-reliance on secondary sources
- **Mitigation:**
  * Use Chinese government documents (Five-Year Plans, white papers)
  * Consult Chinese academic journals (even if not fluent, titles and abstracts helpful)
  * Cite Chinese scholars and analysts
  * Acknowledge limitations of outside perspective
  * Seek expert review from China specialists before publication
